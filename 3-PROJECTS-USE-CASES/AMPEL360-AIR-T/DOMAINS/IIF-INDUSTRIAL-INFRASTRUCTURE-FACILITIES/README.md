# IIF — Industrial Infrastructure, Facilities

**Domain:** Industrial Infrastructure and Maintenance Facilities  
**Code:** IIF  
**Project:** AMPEL360-AIR-T

## Overview

The IIF domain manages all ground-based industrial infrastructure, maintenance facilities, and support equipment required for aircraft operations. This includes jacking systems, lifting equipment, hangars, and MRO (Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul) facilities.

## Scope

- Lifting and shoring equipment (ATA 07)
- Jacking and support systems
- Hangar infrastructure
- MRO facility management
- Ground support equipment (GSE) infrastructure
- Maintenance tooling and fixtures

## ATA Chapter Assignments

### Primary Chapters
- **07** - Lifting and Shoring

### Secondary Involvement
- Ground support equipment coordination with IIS
- Facility integration with AAP for ground operations
- Tooling interfaces with all domains for maintenance

## Cross-Domain Dependencies

| Depends On | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| **AAA** | Aircraft structural load points for jacking |
| **AAP** | Ground platform integration |
| **IIS** | Facility management information systems |
| **LIB** | Maintenance logistics and scheduling |

## Interfaces

- **AAA**: Jacking points, structural load limits
- **AAP**: Ground handling and positioning
- **IIS**: Facility monitoring and control systems
- **LIB**: Maintenance scheduling and resource allocation

## Key Facilities

### 07-LIFTING-SHORING
- Aircraft jacking systems and procedures
- Leveling equipment and techniques
- Shoring and support fixtures
- Load point identification and documentation
- Safety procedures for lifting operations
- Jack pad designs and specifications

## Compliance & Standards

- **ATA iSpec 2200**: Chapter 07 specifications
- **FAA AC 43.13-1B**: Acceptable methods for lifting
- **EASA Part-145**: MRO facility requirements
- **OSHA**: Industrial safety standards
- **ISO 45001**: Occupational health and safety

## Infrastructure Management

- **Hangar Design**: Aircraft maintenance hangars
- **Tool Control**: Maintenance tooling management
- **Facility Systems**: HVAC, lighting, power distribution
- **Safety Systems**: Fire protection, emergency response

## Quantum Optimization Applications

Via QUANTUM_OA for:
- Facility layout optimization
- Maintenance bay scheduling
- Equipment utilization optimization
- Resource allocation across multiple aircraft

## Status

🏗️ **Active Development** — BEZ structure complete, awaiting artifact population
