# Final Design Reports

This directory contains comprehensive design reports that summarize and document the final approved design for certification.

## Purpose

Final Design Reports (FDRs) provide complete technical documentation of the as-designed configuration that will be submitted for certification. These reports serve as the definitive reference for the certified design.

## Contents

Typical final design reports include:
- Design description and rationale
- Loads and stress analysis summaries
- Materials and processes
- Manufacturing specifications
- Quality requirements
- Inspection criteria
- Deviation from standards (if any)

## Naming Convention

Reports should follow the format:
```
FDR-[ATA]-[SYSTEM]-[DISCIPLINE]-[VERSION].pdf
```

Example: `FDR-53-CENTER-BODY-STRUCTURAL-v2.1.pdf`

## Report Structure

Each FDR should contain:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Design overview
   - Key features
   - Compliance summary

2. **Design Description**
   - Configuration details
   - Major components
   - Interfaces

3. **Requirements**
   - Design requirements
   - Regulatory requirements
   - Customer requirements

4. **Analysis Summary**
   - Loads analysis
   - Stress analysis
   - Fatigue analysis
   - Damage tolerance

5. **Materials and Processes**
   - Material specifications
   - Manufacturing processes
   - Quality standards

6. **Compliance**
   - Certification basis
   - Compliance methods
   - Test requirements

7. **Conclusions**
   - Design adequacy
   - Limitations
   - Recommendations

## Review Process

1. **Draft** â€” Initial report preparation
2. **Internal Review** â€” Technical review
3. **Revision** â€” Address comments
4. **Approval** â€” Management sign-off
5. **Release** â€” Formal release for certification

## Traceability

All FDRs must:
- Reference all source analyses
- Include design change history
- Link to CAD models via UTCS
- Document all assumptions
- Include approval signatures

## Status

ðŸ“‹ **Template Ready** â€” Awaiting final design documentation
