# Structural Test Summaries

This directory contains summaries of structural testing conducted for the 53-10 Center Body certification.

## Purpose

Structural test summaries provide evidence of physical testing to substantiate:
- Static strength (limit and ultimate loads)
- Fatigue and damage tolerance
- Material properties and allowables
- Joint and fastener performance
- Lightning strike protection
- Manufacturing quality verification

## Naming Convention

```
TEST-SUMMARY-53-10-{TYPE}-{DATE}.pdf
```

Examples:
- `TEST-SUMMARY-53-10-STATIC-2025-02-15.pdf`
- `TEST-SUMMARY-53-10-FATIGUE-2025-03-01.pdf`
- `TEST-SUMMARY-53-10-COUPON-2025-01-20.pdf`

## Test Types

### Full-Scale Structural Tests
- Complete component or assembly testing
- Ultimate load demonstration

## UTCS Traceability

Each test summary must reference:
- Test plan: `UTCS-MI:CAV:PLAN:TEST:53-10:xxx`
- Test report: `UTCS-MI:CAV:TEST:53-10:xxx:REP`
- Test article: `UTCS-MI:CAV:ARTICLE:53-10:xxx`
- Analysis: `UTCS-MI:CAE:AAA:FEM:53-10:xxx`

## Links to Detailed Reports

Full test reports are stored in:
- `../../PLM/CAV/test-reports/` â€” Complete test documentation
- `../../PLM/CAV/test-data/` â€” Raw data files
