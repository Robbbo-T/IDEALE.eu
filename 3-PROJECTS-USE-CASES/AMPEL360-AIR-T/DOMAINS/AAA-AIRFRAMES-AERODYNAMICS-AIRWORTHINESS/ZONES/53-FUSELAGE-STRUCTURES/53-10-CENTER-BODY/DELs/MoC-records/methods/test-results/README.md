# Test Results

This directory contains test reports and data from physical testing of the 53-10 Center Body.

## Purpose

Test results provide evidence of compliance through physical validation:
- **Test reports** — Summary of test execution, results, and conclusions
- **Raw data** — Time histories, load-displacement curves, strain distributions
- **Failure reports** — Documentation of any failures or anomalies
- **Correlation studies** — Comparison of test results to analysis predictions

## Naming Convention

```
TR-53-10-<TESTCODE>-R<NN>.pdf
```

Examples:
- `TR-53-10-STATIC-01-R01.pdf` — Static test report revision 01
- `TR-53-10-DT-01-R01.pdf` — Damage tolerance test report revision 01
- `TR-53-10-FATIGUE-SPECTRUM-R02.pdf` — Fatigue test report revision 02

## Required Content

Each test report should include:
1. **Objective** — Requirements addressed, test plan reference
2. **Test article** — As-built configuration, deviations from plan, UTCS anchors
3. **Test setup** — Actual configuration, photos, instrumentation layout
4. **Test execution** — Date, personnel, sequence of events, anomalies
5. **Results** — Load-displacement data, strain distributions, failure modes
6. **Analysis correlation** — Comparison to predicted behavior
7. **Pass/fail assessment** — Compliance demonstration status
8. **Conclusions** — Findings, recommendations, follow-up actions
9. **Attachments** — Raw data files, photos, videos, UTCS anchors
10. **Approvals** — Test engineer, checker, design authority

## Data Management

- **Raw data files** — Store in `../../../../../PLM/CAV/` with UTCS anchors
- **Large datasets** — Reference location, do not duplicate in multiple places
- **Photos/videos** — Archive with test report, include UTCS hash
- **Chain of custody** — Document data handling and integrity verification

## Correlation Studies

Compare test results to analytical predictions:
- Strain gauge vs. FEM stresses
- Deflections vs. model predictions
- Failure modes vs. predicted behavior
- Use discrepancies to refine analysis methods

## Failure Investigation

If test failures occur:
- Document failure mode, location, load level
- Perform post-test inspection and fractography
- Identify root cause (design, manufacturing, test procedure)
- Issue ECR (Engineering Change Request) if needed
- Re-test after corrective action
