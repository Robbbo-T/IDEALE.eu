# Draft MoC Records

This directory contains work-in-progress MoC records and supporting documentation that are **not authoritative** and should not be used for certification submissions.

## Purpose

The drafts folder provides a workspace for:
- **Initial preparation** of MoC records before formal review
- **Iterative revisions** during technical review cycles
- **Collaborative editing** between analysts and checkers
- **Version history** before final release to `../records/`

## Important Notes

⚠️ **NOT AUTHORITATIVE** — Files in this directory are working drafts only
- Do not reference draft files in formal submissions
- Do not create UTCS anchors to draft documents
- Do not use drafts as evidence in compliance matrices

## Workflow

1. **Create draft** — Analyst prepares initial MoC record
2. **Internal review** — Checker reviews and provides feedback
3. **Revise** — Analyst incorporates comments and updates draft
4. **Final review** — Design authority and QA approval
5. **Promote** — Move final version to `../records/` with formal naming
6. **Archive** — Keep draft for reference or delete after promotion

## Naming Convention

Use temporary naming that clearly indicates draft status:

```
DRAFT-MOC-CS25-<PARA>-<SUBJECT>-<METHOD>-v<N>.pdf
WIP-<ANALYST>-<TOPIC>-<DATE>.pdf
```

Examples:
- `DRAFT-MOC-CS25-571-FATIGUE-ANALYSIS-v3.pdf`
- `WIP-JSmith-Fastener-Analysis-20250310.pdf`
