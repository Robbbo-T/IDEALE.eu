# Service Experience Evidence

This directory contains documentation of operational history and in-service performance used to demonstrate compliance.

## Purpose

Service experience compliance shows that:
- The design has demonstrated **safe operation** in similar service conditions
- **Fleet data** supports continued airworthiness and reliability
- **In-service issues** have been addressed through corrective actions
- **Operational history** validates design assumptions and margins

## Naming Convention

```
SE-<PROGRAM>-<TOPIC>-R<NN>.pdf
```

Examples:
- `SE-FLEET-RELIABILITY-SUMMARY-R01.pdf` — Overall fleet reliability
- `SE-FATIGUE-INSPECTIONS-R02.pdf` — In-service fatigue findings
- `SE-CORROSION-MONITORING-R01.pdf` — Corrosion prevention validation

## Required Content

Each service experience report should include:
1. **Baseline fleet** — Aircraft type, configuration, operation profile
2. **Service data** — Flight hours, cycles, years in service
3. **Operational environment** — Routes, climates, usage patterns
4. **Inspection findings** — Scheduled and unscheduled maintenance findings
5. **Failure history** — Incidents, service bulletins, airworthiness directives
6. **Corrective actions** — Design changes, inspection programs, repairs
7. **Reliability metrics** — MTBF, dispatch reliability, AOG rates
8. **Applicability** — Why this experience is relevant to new design
9. **UTCS anchors** — Links to service bulletins, maintenance data
10. **Approvals** — Reliability engineer, airworthiness engineer, design authority

## Types of Service Experience

### Structural Integrity
- Fatigue cracking findings and locations
- Corrosion inspection results
- Damage tolerance validation
- Widespread fatigue damage (WFD) assessment

### Materials Performance
- Material degradation in service
- Environmental effects (UV, moisture, chemicals)
- Lightning strike damage history
- Paint system performance

### Manufacturing Quality
- In-service defect discovery rate
- Assembly issues found during maintenance
- Fastener condition and replacement rates
- Seal and bonding durability

### Operational Loads
- Exceedance monitoring data
- Hard landing occurrences
- Load validation from flight data recorder
- Usage severity compared to design assumptions

## Fleet Data Sources

- **Maintenance records** — Scheduled and unscheduled maintenance
- **Service bulletins** — Fleet modifications and inspections
- **Airworthiness directives (AD)** — Mandatory actions
- **Reliability reports** — Monthly/quarterly fleet performance
- **Accident/incident reports** — Failure investigations
- **Continuous airworthiness programs** — Aging aircraft monitoring

## Applicability Justification

Demonstrate that service experience is relevant:
- Similar structural design and materials
- Comparable operational environment
- Equivalent or more severe usage
- Same or higher safety standards

## Limitations

Service experience alone may not be sufficient for:
- New materials or manufacturing processes
- Significant design changes from baseline
- More severe operating conditions
- New failure modes not seen in service
