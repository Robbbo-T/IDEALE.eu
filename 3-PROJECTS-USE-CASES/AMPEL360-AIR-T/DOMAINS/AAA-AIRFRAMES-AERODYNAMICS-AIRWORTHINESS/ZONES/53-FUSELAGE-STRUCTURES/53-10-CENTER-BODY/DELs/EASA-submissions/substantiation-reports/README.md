# Substantiation Reports

This directory contains formal substantiation reports demonstrating compliance with structural certification requirements for the 53-10 Center Body.

## Purpose

Substantiation reports provide detailed technical evidence supporting certification claims, including:
- Static strength analysis (CS-25.305, CS-25.561)
- Fatigue and damage tolerance (CS-25.571)
- Material properties and allowables (CS-25.603)
- Joint and fastener analysis (CS-25.607)
- Lightning and EMI protection (CS-25.1316)

## Naming Convention

```
SUBST-53-10-{TOPIC}-{REV}.pdf
```

Examples:
- `SUBST-53-10-STATIC-STRENGTH-R01.pdf`
- `SUBST-53-10-FATIGUE-DT-R01.pdf`

### Materials & Processes Reports
- Material qualification
- Allowables substantiation
- Process specifications
- Joint and fastener analysis

### Lightning/EMI Protection Reports
- Lightning strike zone analysis
- Bonding and grounding
- EMI shielding effectiveness
- HIRF protection

## Required Elements

Each substantiation report must include:
- [ ] Executive summary
- [ ] Applicable requirements
- [ ] Analysis methodology
- [ ] Model description and validation
- [ ] Load cases and conditions
- [ ] Results and margins
- [ ] Conclusions and compliance statement
- [ ] References to source data
- [ ] UTCS anchors for traceability

## CAE/CAV Evidence Links

Substantiation reports must reference:
- FEM models in `../../PLM/CAE/FEM/`
- Test evidence in `../structural-test-summaries/`
- Material data in `../../PLM/materials/`
- Drawing packages in `../../PLM/CAD/`

## Traceability

All reports must:
- Be listed in the MoC matrix in `../moc-cross-reference/`
- Have corresponding UTCS record in `../utcs/`
- Be included in submission package in `../submissions/`
- Reference upstream CAE/CAV UTCS anchors
