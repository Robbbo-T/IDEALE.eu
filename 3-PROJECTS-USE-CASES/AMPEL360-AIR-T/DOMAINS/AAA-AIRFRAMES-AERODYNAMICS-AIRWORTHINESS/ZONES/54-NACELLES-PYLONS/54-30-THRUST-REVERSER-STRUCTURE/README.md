## Coordination Notes

### AAA/PPP Interface
This sub-zone (AAA) focuses on **structural aspects** of thrust reversers:

- Material and manufacturing
- Structural testing and certification

ATA 78 (PPP domain) covers **functional aspects**:
- Actuation systems and controls
- Hydraulic/pneumatic systems
- Lock mechanisms and indication
- System functional testing

Close coordination is required through ICDs and joint reviews.
