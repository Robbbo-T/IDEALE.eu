# 56-30-EMERGENCY-EXIT-WINDOWS â€” Emergency Exit Windows

**ATA Chapter**: 56 (Windows)  
**Sub-Zone**: 56-30  
**Domain**: AAA (Airframes, Aerodynamics, Airworthiness)  
**Project**: AMPEL360-AIR-T

## Overview

Emergency exit windows provide transparency in over-wing exits and other emergency egress points. These windows must meet stringent evacuation requirements, provide adequate visibility for emergency operations, and maintain structural integrity. This sub-zone covers design, installation, operation, and certification of emergency exit windows.

## Scope

### Components Covered
* **Over-wing exit windows** â€” Transparencies in Type III exits
* **Window panes** â€” Structural transparency assemblies
* **Retention systems** â€” Quick-release or removable mechanisms
* **Frames and mounting** â€” Structural attachment to exit door/hatch structure
* **Seals** â€” Environmental sealing for normal operations
* **Markings and placards** â€” Operating instructions, emergency markings

### Design and Analysis
* Emergency exit window structural design
* Pressurization loads analysis
* Rapid removal or ejection mechanisms
* Retention under normal and emergency loads
* Visibility requirements for emergency operations
* Marking and placard design (visibility, durability)
* Lighting requirements for night operations

### Certification Evidence
* Evacuation demonstration (removal time)
* Proof and ultimate pressure tests
* Retention system qualification
* Visibility verification
* Marking durability tests
* Operability tests (removal, installation)

## Key Design Considerations

### Regulatory Requirements (CS 25.807, 25.809, 25.810)
* **Evacuation** â€” Emergency exits must be operable from inside and outside
* **Type III exits** â€” Over-wing exits with specific size and operation requirements
* **Removal time** â€” Rapid removal for emergency egress (typically <10 seconds)
* **Visibility** â€” Adequate visibility for crew/passenger to assess evacuation route
* **Markings** â€” Clear operating instructions, visible in emergency lighting
* **Accessibility** â€” Reachable and operable by passengers or crew

### Structural Requirements
* **Pressurization loads** â€” Design for maximum differential pressure (normal ops)
* **Emergency loads** â€” Withstand removal forces without fragmentation
* **Retention** â€” Secure under normal flight loads, gust loads
* **Fail-safe** â€” No hazardous failure modes (e.g., explosive ejection)
* **Frame strength** â€” Support window and transfer loads to exit structure

### Operational Requirements
* **Removal mechanism** â€” Intuitive, reliable, quick-acting
* **Retention during flight** â€” No inadvertent opening or loosening
* **Installation** â€” Straightforward re-installation after removal (for maintenance)
* **Durability** â€” Repeated operation without degradation
* **Emergency lighting** â€” Visible markings in low-light conditions

### Visibility and Marking Requirements
* **Visibility** â€” Clear view of wing surface and evacuation route
* **Optical quality** â€” Adequate clarity (haze/distortion less critical than cockpit)
* **Operating instructions** â€” Clear, durable, illuminated or reflective markings
* **Color coding** â€” High-contrast markings for emergency identification
* **Pictograms** â€” Intuitive graphical instructions for operation
