# 06-40-GROUND-CLEARANCES â€” Aircraft Ground Clearance Specifications

**ATA Chapter**: 06 (Dimensions and Stations)  
**Sub-Zone**: 06-40  
**Domain**: AAA (Airframes, Aerodynamics, Airworthiness)  
**Project**: AMPEL360-AIR-T

## Overview

The ground clearances sub-zone defines minimum clearances between aircraft and ground during all operational conditions, including:
- Static ground clearance (gear extended)
- Ground clearance during rotation (takeoff)
- Ground clearance during landing (tail strike)
- Taxiway and runway clearances
- Ramp and hangar clearances
- Service equipment clearances

## Scope

This sub-zone contains all design, analysis, and documentation artifacts for aircraft ground clearance specifications.
