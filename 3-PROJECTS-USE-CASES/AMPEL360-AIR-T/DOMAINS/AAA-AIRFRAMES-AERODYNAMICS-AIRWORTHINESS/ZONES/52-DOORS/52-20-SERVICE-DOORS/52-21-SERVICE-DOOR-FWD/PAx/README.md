# PAx â€” Packaging and Integration

This directory manages the packaging and integration aspects of the component, coordinating between onboard and external systems.

## Purpose

PAx handles the physical and functional integration of the component with the aircraft, ensuring proper interfaces and compatibility with adjacent systems.

## Structure

```
PAx/
â”œâ”€ ONB/          # Onboard systems integration
â”œâ”€ OUT/          # External systems integration
