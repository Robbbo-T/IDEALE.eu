# Deliveries (DELs)

This directory contains all formal certification documentation and design evidence required for regulatory approval.

## Purpose

DELs organize and manage the complete set of documentation that demonstrates compliance with airworthiness requirements. This is the primary interface with certification authorities (EASA, FAA).

## Structure

## Certification Process Flow

1. **Design Phase**
   - Requirements definition
   - Design development
   - Analysis and testing

2. **Documentation Phase** (DELs)
   - Prepare MoC records
   - Write FDRs
   - Compile data packages

3. **Submission Phase**
   - Submit to EASA
   - Address authority questions
   - Obtain approvals

4. **Approval Phase**
   - Receive Type Certificate
   - Issue airworthiness statements
   - Archive approved documents

## Document Control

All DEL documents must:
- Follow revision control
- Include approval signatures
- Reference UTCS anchors
- Maintain traceability to design data
- Be archived upon approval

## Applicable Standards

- **EASA CS-25** â€” Large Aeroplanes
- **FAA 14 CFR Part 25** â€” Airworthiness Standards
- **ATA iSpec 2200** â€” Information Standards
- **S1000D** â€” Technical Publications

## Traceability

DELs must maintain complete traceability to:
- Design requirements (PLM/CAO/)
- Analysis data (PLM/CAE/)
- Test results (tests/)
- CAD models (PLM/CAD/)

## Quality Requirements

All DEL documents must:
- Pass internal review before submission
- Include all required signatures
- Reference all supporting data
- Follow agency formatting requirements
- Maintain version control
