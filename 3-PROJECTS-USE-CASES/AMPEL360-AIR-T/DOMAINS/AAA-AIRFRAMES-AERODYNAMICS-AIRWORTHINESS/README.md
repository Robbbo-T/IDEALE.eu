# AAA-AIRFRAMES-AERODYNAMICS-AIRWORTHINESS

This domain folder contains all technical documentation, models, and compliance evidence related to the structural design, aerodynamic performance, and airworthiness certification of the **AMPEL360-AIR-T** platform.

The core mission focus here is achieving structural integrity for the Blended Wing Body (BWB) and validating aerodynamic efficiency and control in the transonic regime under Hâ‚‚ hybrid-electric operational constraints.

## 1. Domain Data Layers (PLM Focus)

This domain is the primary user and generator of data within the **CAE** and **CAV** suites, generating the foundation for certification arguments.

| Layer | Sub-Category | Key Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CAE** | FEM, CFD, MBD, EMI | Structural stress/fatigue, transonic aero simulations, flight control kinematics, and lightning protection studies. |
| **CAD** | ASSY, PRT, DRW | Management of the geometric definition of the airframe, including material specs and tolerances (GD&T). |
| **CAV** | CERT, QIP, MEAS | Management of the EASA CS-25 compliance matrix, test reports, and dimensional inspection data validation. |
| **CAO** | REQ, CON, SYS | Decomposition of high-level performance and safety requirements into verifiable design specifications. |
| **CAS** | SRM, AMM | Development of structural repair manuals and maintenance procedures specific to advanced composite airframes. |

## 2. TFA Integration

The AAA domain relies on the TFA flow to optimize structural weight, predict flight performance envelopes, and manage the vast amounts of sensor data required for predictive airworthiness.

| TFA Component | Role in AAA Domain |
| :--- | :--- |
| **QS** (Input) | Provides the probabilistic state space for structural health and operational environment (e.g., potential gust loads, icing probability). |
| **FWD** (Output) | Calculates forward-looking aerodynamic stability and structural integrity risk profiles (Forward Wave Dynamics). |
| **UE** (Data Bridge) | Represents the collapsed state of a specific airframe component (e.g., the current load state, current material fatigue index). |
| **CB/QB** (Solver) | **QB** is used for complex topology optimization problems (weight vs. stiffness). **CB** validates these solutions against physical and regulatory constraints (e.g., minimum factor of safety). |
| **Traceability** | All CAE meshes, simulation setup files, and test results are indexed via **UTCS** to prove compliance with certified limits. |

## 3. Directory Index

### New ATA Chapter-Based Structure

| Folder | Content Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [`ZONES/`](./ZONES/) | **Primary structure** â€” Organizes structural zones by ATA chapter (53-Fuselage, 57-Wings, etc.). Each sub-zone contains complete BEZ (DELs, PAx, PLM, QUANTUM_OA, etc.). See [ATA-STRUCTURE-EXAMPLE.md](../ATA-STRUCTURE-EXAMPLE.md) for details. |
| [`domain-config.yaml`](./domain-config.yaml) | Domain-level configuration file. |
| `README.md` | This file â€” domain overview and guidance. |

### Legacy Structure (Transitioning)

The following directories represent the legacy domain-level BEZ structure. New work should be organized within `ZONES/` following ATA chapter assignments:
