# 57-10-BOX-SECTION â€” Wing Structure Component

**ATA Chapter**: 57 (Wing Structures)  
**Sub-Zone**: 57-10  
**Domain**: AAA (Airframes, Aerodynamics, Airworthiness)  
**Project**: AMPEL360-AIR-T

## Overview

The wing box is the primary load-bearing structure of the wing, consisting of:
- **Front spar** â€” Primary forward structural member
- **Rear spar** â€” Primary aft structural member
- **Upper skin panels** â€” Top surface load path and aerodynamic surface
- **Lower skin panels** â€” Bottom surface load path and aerodynamic surface
- **Internal structure** â€” Ribs, stringers, and attachment fittings within the box
- **Wing-to-fuselage carry-through** â€” Central structural connection
- **Fuel tank structural boundaries** â€” Integral fuel tank structure

The wing box transfers all wing loads (bending, torsion, shear) to the fuselage center section and provides the foundation for all other wing components.

## Scope

This sub-zone contains all design, analysis, manufacturing, and certification artifacts for the wing box primary structure, including:
- Structural design and analysis of main spars
- Wing box sizing and optimization
- Load path definition and verification
- Integral fuel tank structure
- Fail-safe and damage tolerance assessments
- Manufacturing process definition
- Assembly and joining procedures
- Non-destructive testing requirements

## Key Design Considerations

### Structural Requirements
- **Ultimate load capability**: 1.5 Ã— limit loads (CS 25.303)
- **Fatigue life**: Design service goal (DSG) typically 90,000 flight cycles
- **Damage tolerance**: Residual strength with critical damage
- **Fail-safe design**: Multiple load paths and crack arresters
- **Weight optimization**: Minimize structural weight while meeting requirements

### Material Selection
- **Aluminum alloys**: 2024-T3, 7075-T6 for primary structure
- **Composite materials**: Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) for weight savings
- **Titanium alloys**: Ti-6Al-4V for high-stress areas
- **Advanced materials**: Aluminum-lithium alloys for next-generation designs

### Manufacturing Considerations
- Large panel machining and forming
- Automated fastening systems
- Quality control and inspection
- Assembly jig and fixture design
- Surface treatment and corrosion protection
