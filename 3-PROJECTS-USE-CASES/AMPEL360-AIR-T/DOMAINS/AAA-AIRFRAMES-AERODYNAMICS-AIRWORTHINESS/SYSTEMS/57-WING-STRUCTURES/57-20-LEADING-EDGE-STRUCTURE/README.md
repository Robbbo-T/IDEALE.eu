# 57-20-LEADING-EDGE-STRUCTURE â€” Wing Structure Component

**ATA Chapter**: 57 (Wing Structures)  
**Sub-Zone**: 57-20  
**Domain**: AAA (Airframes, Aerodynamics, Airworthiness)  
**Project**: AMPEL360-AIR-T

## Overview

The leading edge structure forms the forward aerodynamic surface of the wing and provides:
- **Leading edge spar** â€” Primary structural member supporting the leading edge
- **Leading edge panels** â€” Aerodynamic surface and structural skin
- **Slat tracks and supports** â€” High-lift device mounting structure
- **Slat rails and carriages** â€” Slat deployment mechanism support
- **Access doors and panels** â€” Maintenance access to internal systems
- **Anti-ice system integration** â€” Thermal or pneumatic de-icing provisions
- **Lightning strike protection** â€” Conductive paths and lightning diverters

The leading edge structure must withstand bird strike loads, ice accretion forces, and high-lift device deployment loads while maintaining aerodynamic efficiency.

## Scope

This sub-zone contains all design, analysis, manufacturing, and certification artifacts for the leading edge structure, including:
- Leading edge spar structural design
- Leading edge skin panel design and optimization
- Slat track and support structure
- Bird strike analysis and certification
- Ice protection system integration
- Lightning strike protection design
- Manufacturing and assembly processes
- Damage tolerance and inspection programs

## Key Design Considerations

### Aerodynamic Requirements
- **Leading edge profile**: Maintains optimal airflow and minimizes drag
- **Surface quality**: Smooth surface finish for laminar flow (where applicable)
- **Slat integration**: Seamless integration with high-lift devices
- **Stall characteristics**: Progressive stall behavior

### Structural Requirements
- **Bird strike resistance**: Certification to CS 25.571 (4 lb bird at cruise speed)
- **Impact damage tolerance**: Sustain damage without catastrophic failure
- **Environmental loads**: Ice loads, thermal stresses, and pressure differential
- **Fatigue life**: High-cycle fatigue from slat deployment

### Systems Integration
- **Anti-ice systems**: Hot air or electrical heating elements
- **Slat actuation**: Mechanical or hydraulic actuation system
- **Sensors**: Angle of attack sensors and ice detectors
- **Lightning protection**: Conductive strips and bonding

### Material Selection
- **Aluminum alloys**: 2024-T3 clad for corrosion resistance
- **Composite materials**: Glass or carbon fiber for leading edge panels
- **Erosion-resistant coatings**: Polyurethane or nickel-based coatings
- **Conductive materials**: Aluminum or copper mesh for lightning protection
