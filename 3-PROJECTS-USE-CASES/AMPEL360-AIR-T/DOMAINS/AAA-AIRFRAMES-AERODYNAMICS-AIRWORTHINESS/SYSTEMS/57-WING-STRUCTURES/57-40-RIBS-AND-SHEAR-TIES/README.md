# 57-40-RIBS-AND-SHEAR-TIES â€” Wing Structure Component

**ATA Chapter**: 57 (Wing Structures)  
**Sub-Zone**: 57-40  
**Domain**: AAA (Airframes, Aerodynamics, Airworthiness)  
**Project**: AMPEL360-AIR-T

## Overview

Wing ribs and shear ties provide internal structural support and load distribution:
- **Main ribs** â€” Primary load-bearing transverse members
- **Intermediate ribs** â€” Secondary ribs between main ribs for skin support
- **Nose ribs** â€” Forward ribs supporting leading edge structure
- **Aft ribs** â€” Rear ribs supporting trailing edge structure
- **Shear ties** â€” Diagonal bracing members resisting shear loads
- **Rib-to-spar fittings** â€” Connection hardware between ribs and spars
- **Fuel tank sealing** â€” Rib sealant provisions for integral tanks
- **Lightening holes** â€” Weight reduction cutouts with edge reinforcement

Ribs maintain wing cross-sectional shape, distribute loads from skins to spars, and provide mounting provisions for systems and equipment.

## Scope

This sub-zone contains all design, analysis, manufacturing, and certification artifacts for wing ribs and shear ties, including:
- Rib structural design and sizing
- Shear tie design and placement optimization
- Rib-to-spar connection design
- Fuel tank sealing provisions
- Lightening hole patterns and reinforcement
- Buckling and crippling analysis
- Manufacturing drawings and specifications
- Assembly and installation procedures

## Key Design Considerations

### Structural Requirements
- **Load distribution**: Transfer loads from skins to spars efficiently
- **Shape maintenance**: Maintain aerodynamic wing profile under load
- **Local reinforcement**: Support concentrated loads from systems
- **Fuel tank integrity**: Sealed ribs for integral fuel tanks
- **Damage tolerance**: Crack arrest and fail-safe features

### Design Features
- **Rib web design**: Optimized thickness and lightening hole patterns
- **Rib caps and flanges**: Sufficient stiffness for stability
- **Shear tie configuration**: Optimize for torsional stiffness
- **Attachment design**: Riveted, bolted, or bonded connections
- **Manufacturing considerations**: Formability and assembly access

### Analysis Requirements
- **Buckling analysis**: Web and flange buckling under compression
- **Crippling analysis**: Local instability at fittings
- **Fastener analysis**: Bearing and shear strength verification
- **Fatigue analysis**: High-cycle and low-cycle fatigue
- **Damage tolerance**: Residual strength with damage

### Material Selection
- **Aluminum alloys**: 2024-T3 for webs, 7075-T6 for caps and fittings
- **Composite materials**: Carbon fiber for weight-critical applications
- **Fasteners**: Hi-Lok, Hi-Lite, or rivets per design requirements
- **Sealants**: Fuel-resistant sealants for integral tank ribs
