# 57-30-TRAILING-EDGE-STRUCTURE â€” Wing Structure Component

**ATA Chapter**: 57 (Wing Structures)  
**Sub-Zone**: 57-30  
**Domain**: AAA (Airframes, Aerodynamics, Airworthiness)  
**Project**: AMPEL360-AIR-T

## Overview

The trailing edge structure forms the aft aerodynamic surface of the wing and provides:
- **Trailing edge spar** â€” Aft structural member and mounting for high-lift devices
- **Trailing edge panels** â€” Aerodynamic closure and structural skin
- **Flap support structure** â€” Flap tracks, hinges, and support beams
- **Flap track fairings** â€” Aerodynamic fairings for flap mechanism
- **Aileron support structure** â€” Aileron hinge fittings and support
- **Spoiler support structure** â€” Spoiler mounting provisions
- **Access panels** â€” Maintenance access to control surface mechanisms

The trailing edge structure must support the high loads from deployed flaps and control surfaces while maintaining structural efficiency and aerodynamic performance.

## Scope

This sub-zone contains all design, analysis, manufacturing, and certification artifacts for the trailing edge structure, including:
- Trailing edge spar structural design
- Flap track and support beam design
- Hinge fitting design and analysis
- Control surface attachment provisions
- Aerodynamic fairing design
- Load path verification and optimization
- Manufacturing and assembly processes
- Fatigue and damage tolerance analysis

## Key Design Considerations

### Structural Requirements
- **High-lift device loads**: Large download forces from deployed flaps
- **Control surface actuation loads**: Aileron and spoiler hinge moments
- **Flutter prevention**: Adequate stiffness to prevent flutter
- **Fatigue life**: High-cycle fatigue from control surface movement
- **Damage tolerance**: Fail-safe design for critical load paths

### Aerodynamic Requirements
- **Smooth contours**: Minimize drag and maintain airflow quality
- **Flap deployment**: Smooth flap motion without binding
- **Gap sealing**: Minimize air leakage through gaps
- **Wake characteristics**: Manage wake turbulence

### Systems Integration
- **Flap actuation**: Hydraulic or electric flap drive system
- **Aileron actuation**: Dual or triple redundant actuation
- **Spoiler actuation**: Hydraulic or electric spoiler system
- **Position sensing**: LVDT or RVDT position feedback

### Material Selection
- **Aluminum alloys**: 7075-T6 for high-strength applications
- **Steel fittings**: High-strength steel for hinge fittings and lugs
- **Composite materials**: Carbon fiber for fairings and secondary structure
- **Corrosion protection**: Anodizing, primers, and sealants
