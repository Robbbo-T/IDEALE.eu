## Key Interfaces

### Structural Interfaces
- **53-XX-FUSELAGE** â€” Door frame integration with fuselage structure
- **51-XX-STANDARDS** â€” Structural design standards and practices
- **56-XX-WINDOWS** â€” Adjacent window structures (where applicable)

### Systems Interfaces
- **52-XX-DOOR-OPERATION** (MEC domain) â€” Door actuation and operating mechanisms
- **25-XX-EQUIPMENT** (CCC domain) â€” Evacuation equipment (where applicable)
- **21-XX-AIR-CONDITIONING** (DDD domain) â€” Door seals and pressurization interface
- **33-XX-LIGHTING** (EEE domain) â€” Exit lighting (where applicable)

- Door failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA)
- Crash loads and energy absorption (where applicable)
- Pressure differential testing
- Fatigue and damage tolerance analysis

## TFA Flow

This sub-zone follows the canonical TFA flow:
**QS â†’ FWD â†’ UE â†’ FE â†’ CB â†’ QB**

- **QS** (Quantum Superposition State) â€” Door design space exploration
- **FWD** (Forward Wave Dynamics) â€” Loading scenarios (pressure, crash, operational)
- **UE** (Unit/Unique Element) â€” Specific door component definitions
- **FE** (Federation Entanglement) â€” Interface coordination with fuselage and systems
- **CB** (Classical Bit/Solver) â€” Structural analysis (FEA, stress analysis)
- **QB** (Qubit Inspired Solver) â€” Door structure optimization

## UTCS Anchors

All artifacts must include UTCS anchors for traceability:
```
UTCS-MI:CAD:AAA:52-12:DOOR:rev[X]
UTCS-MI:CAE:AAA:52-12:STRESS:rev[X]
UTCS-MI:DEL:AAA:52-12:CERT:rev[X]
```

## Status

ðŸš§ **In Development** â€” Structure defined, artifacts to be populated
