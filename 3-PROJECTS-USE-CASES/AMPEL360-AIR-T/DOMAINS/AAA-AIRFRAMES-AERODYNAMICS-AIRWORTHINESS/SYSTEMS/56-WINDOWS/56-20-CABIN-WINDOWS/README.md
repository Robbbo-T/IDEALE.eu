# 56-20-CABIN-WINDOWS â€” Cabin Windows

**ATA Chapter**: 56 (Windows)  
**Sub-Zone**: 56-20  
**Domain**: AAA (Airframes, Aerodynamics, Airworthiness)  
**Project**: AMPEL360-AIR-T

## Overview

Cabin windows provide natural lighting and visibility for passengers while maintaining structural integrity under pressurization loads. These windows must be fail-safe, scratch-resistant, and provide acoustic attenuation. This sub-zone covers all passenger cabin windows and their associated frames, seals, and retention systems.

## Scope

### Components Covered
* **Cabin window panes** â€” Triple-pane or dual-pane laminated assemblies
* **Outer pane** â€” Pressure-bearing structural element
* **Middle pane** â€” Scratch shield and fail-safe backup (triple-pane)
* **Inner pane** â€” Interior scratch shield and reveal
* **Window frames** â€” Structural mounting to fuselage frames
* **Retention systems** â€” Mechanical or bonded retention
* **Seals and gaskets** â€” Environmental sealing
* **Reveal moldings** â€” Interior aesthetic trim

### Design and Analysis
* Triple-pane or dual-pane structural design
* Fail-safe load paths and redundancy
* Pressurization stress analysis
* Fatigue and damage tolerance
* Acoustic attenuation analysis
* Optical quality (haze, clarity)
* Scratch-resistant coating selection
* Frame and seal design

### Manufacturing and Installation
* Lamination or assembly of multi-pane units
* Coating application (scratch-resistant, UV-resistant)
* Frame bonding or mechanical fastening
* Seal installation and compression
* Quality control and inspection
* Shim plans for proper fit

### Certification Evidence
* Proof and ultimate pressure tests
* Fail-safe demonstration (single pane failure)
* Fatigue testing (pressure cycles)
* Environmental aging (UV, humidity, salt fog)
* Acoustic transmission loss tests
* Optical quality verification

## Key Design Considerations

### Structural Requirements
* **Pressurization loads** â€” Design for maximum differential pressure
* **Fail-safe design** â€” Outer pane failure must not cause rapid decompression
* **Proof pressure** â€” 1.0Ã— maximum differential pressure
* **Ultimate pressure** â€” 1.5Ã— maximum differential pressure
* **Fatigue life** â€” Service life pressure cycles with damage tolerance
* **Damage tolerance** â€” Ability to sustain cracks or flaws until inspection

### Optical and Aesthetic Requirements
* **Haze** â€” Low haze for clear view (ASTM D1003)
* **Distortion** â€” Minimal optical distortion for passenger comfort
* **Scratch resistance** â€” Hard coatings to resist handling and cleaning damage
* **Color neutrality** â€” No color tinting (unless intentional for solar control)
* **UV stability** â€” No yellowing or crazing over service life
* **Interior aesthetics** â€” Clean reveal design, no sharp edges

### Acoustic Requirements
* **Sound transmission loss** â€” Attenuation of exterior noise (dB reduction)
* **Multi-pane design** â€” Air gaps or damping layers for noise reduction
* **Seal integrity** â€” Prevent acoustic leaks around perimeter
* **Frequency response** â€” Effective across broad frequency range

### Environmental Requirements (DO-160)
* **Temperature** â€” -55Â°C to +70Â°C operating range
* **UV exposure** â€” Long-term stability without degradation
* **Humidity** â€” Resistance to moisture ingress and condensation
* **Fluids** â€” Resistance to cleaning agents, de-icing fluids
* **Sand and dust** â€” Abrasion resistance and seal effectiveness
