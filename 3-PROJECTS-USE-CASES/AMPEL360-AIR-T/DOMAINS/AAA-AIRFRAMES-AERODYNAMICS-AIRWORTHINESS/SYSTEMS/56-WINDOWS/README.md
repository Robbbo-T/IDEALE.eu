* Electrical bonding and continuity verification
* Torque procedures for mechanical fasteners
* Quality inspections and sign-offs

## QUANTUM_OA Applications

Quantum-inspired optimization algorithms may be applied to:

* **Laminate stacking** — Optimal ply sequence for bird strike and pressurization
* **Frame topology** — Load path optimization around cutouts
* **Supply chain** — Vendor selection, logistics, inventory optimization
* **Maintenance scheduling** — Predictive maintenance based on flight hours, cycles, environmental exposure

## CAV — Typical Evidence

### Bird Strike Testing
* 4-lb bird at design cruise speed (CS 25.775)
* Explicit FEM simulation (LS-DYNA, Abaqus/Explicit)
* Physical testing on representative articles
* No penetration, no loss of structural integrity

### Pressurization Testing
* Proof pressure: 1.0× maximum differential pressure
* Ultimate pressure: 1.5× (or 2.0×) maximum differential pressure
* Pressure cycling: service life cycles
* Fail-safe demonstration (single pane failure)

### Optical Quality Testing
* Haze measurement per ASTM D1003 (typically <3% for flight deck)
* Distortion measurement (angular deviation, typically <2 mrad)
* Light transmission (>70% visible light)
* Refractive uniformity across viewing area

### Environmental Testing (DO-160)
* Temperature: -55°C to +70°C
* UV exposure: long-term stability without yellowing
* Humidity: resistance to moisture ingress, condensation
* Fluids: resistance to fuels, de-icing fluids, cleaning agents
* Sand and dust: abrasion resistance, seal integrity

### Lightning Protection Testing (CS 25.1316)
* Direct strike: high-current discharge
* Indirect effects: electromagnetic interference
* Electrical continuity: bonding resistance measurement
* No damage or penetration after lightning strike
