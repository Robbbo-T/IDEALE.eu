# Means of Compliance (MoC) Records

This directory contains documentation demonstrating how design requirements comply with certification specifications.

## Purpose

MoC records establish the methodology and evidence used to show compliance with regulatory requirements. Each record links a requirement to its compliance demonstration.

## Contents

Typical MoC records include:
- Compliance methods (analysis, test, similarity, etc.)
- Supporting documentation references
- Test plans and procedures
- Analysis methods and assumptions
- Certification review items (CRI)

## Naming Convention

Files should follow the format:
```
MOC-[CS-SECTION]-[REQUIREMENT]-[METHOD]-[DATE].pdf
```

Example: `MOC-CS25-305-STRESS-ANALYSIS-20250127.pdf`

## Compliance Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Analysis** | Engineering calculations and simulations |
| **Test** | Physical testing and validation |
| **Inspection** | Visual or dimensional verification |
| **Similarity** | Comparison to certified designs |
| **Service Experience** | Historical operational data |

## Structure

Each MoC record should contain:
1. **Requirement** â€” Specific regulation reference (e.g., CS 25.305(a))
2. **Method** â€” How compliance is demonstrated
3. **Evidence** â€” Supporting data and documentation
4. **Status** â€” Compliance status (open, closed, approved)

## Traceability

All MoC records must:
- Reference specific CS paragraphs
- Link to supporting analysis/test data
- Include reviewer sign-off
- Connect to EASA submissions

## Status

ðŸ“‹ **Template Ready** â€” Awaiting compliance documentation
