# Analysis Evidence

This directory contains engineering analysis artifacts used as evidence in MoC records for the 53-10 Center Body.

## Purpose

Analysis evidence demonstrates compliance through:
- **Engineering calculations** — Hand calculations, spreadsheets, MathCAD
- **FEM analysis** — Finite Element Method stress, fatigue, buckling, vibration
- **Analytical models** — Simplified models with documented assumptions
- **Margin summaries** — Safety factors, reserve factors, margins of safety
- **Sensitivity studies** — Parametric variations and worst-case scenarios

## Naming Convention

```
ANA-53-10-<TOPIC>-R<NN>.pdf
```

Examples:
- `ANA-53-10-FATIGUE-R02.pdf` — Fatigue analysis revision 02
- `ANA-53-10-STATIC-ULTIMATE-R01.pdf` — Static ultimate load analysis
- `ANA-53-10-BUCKLING-R03.pdf` — Buckling stability analysis

## Required Content

Each analysis report should include:
1. **Objective** — What is being analyzed and why
2. **Configuration** — CAD/ASSY revs, materials, UTCS anchors
3. **Load cases** — Applied loads, boundary conditions, load factors
4. **Methodology** — Analysis approach, software, validation
5. **Assumptions** — Simplifications and their justification
6. **Results** — Stresses, deflections, margins by location
7. **Conclusions** — Pass/fail assessment, recommendations
8. **Sign-off** — Analyst, checker, design authority

## FEM Analysis

For FEM-based evidence, also provide:
- Model description (element types, mesh density)
- Material properties with UTCS anchors
- Boundary condition details
- Verification and validation (V&V) summary
- Post-processing methodology

## Traceability

Link analysis to:
- **Requirements** — CS-25 paragraphs being addressed
- **MoC records** — Parent compliance documentation in `../records/`
- **UTCS anchors** — Immutable references to CAD, materials, loads
- **Design data** — FEM models in `../../../../../PLM/CAE/`
