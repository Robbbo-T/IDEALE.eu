# Means of Compliance Cross-Reference

This directory contains the requirement-to-evidence mapping matrix for the 53-10 Center Body EASA submissions.

## Purpose

The MoC cross-reference provides a comprehensive mapping between:
- Certification requirements (CS-25, AMC, ACJ)
- Means of compliance (Analysis, Test, Inspection)
- Evidence artifacts (reports, tests, inspections)
- UTCS anchors for traceability

## Naming Convention

Example: `MOC-MATRIX-53-10-v2.1.xlsx`

## Matrix Structure

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Req ID** | CS-25 paragraph | CS-25.561 |
| **Requirement** | Brief description | Emergency landing loads |
| **Applicability** | Applicable/NA/SC | Applicable |
| **MoC Method** | A/T/I or combination | A (Analysis) |
| **Evidence** | Report/test reference | SUBST-53-10-STATIC-STRENGTH-R01.pdf |
| **UTCS Anchor** | Traceability ID | UTCS-MI:CAE:AAA:FEM:53-10:STATIC:R01 |
| **Status** | Completion status | Complete ‚úÖ / In Progress ‚è≥ |
| **EASA Status** | Authority review | Accepted / Under Review / TBD |
| **Notes** | Additional information | See also Issue Paper A02 |

## MoC Codes

- **A** = Analysis (FEM, hand calculations, CFD)
- **T** = Test (structural test, coupon test)
- **I** = Inspection (material inspection, process verification)
- **A/T** = Combined analysis and test
- **A/I** = Analysis with inspection verification

## CS-25 Coverage

The matrix must cover all applicable requirements including:

### Subpart C ‚Äî Structure
- CS-25.301 ‚Äî Loads
- CS-25.303 ‚Äî Factor of safety
- CS-25.305 ‚Äî Strength and deformation
- CS-25.561 ‚Äî Emergency landing conditions
- CS-25.571 ‚Äî Damage tolerance and fatigue

### Subpart D ‚Äî Design and Construction
- CS-25.603 ‚Äî Materials
- CS-25.605 ‚Äî Fabrication methods
- CS-25.607 ‚Äî Fasteners
- CS-25.609 ‚Äî Protection of structure

### Subpart F ‚Äî Equipment
- CS-25.1316 ‚Äî Electrical and electronic system lightning protection

## Evidence Links

The matrix must link to:
- Substantiation reports in `../substantiation-reports/`
- Fatigue analysis in `../fatigue-analysis-package/`
- Lightning protection in `../lightning-strike-package/`
- Test summaries in `../structural-test-summaries/`
- Source data in `../../PLM/CAE/`, `../../PLM/CAD/`

## UTCS Integration

Each evidence item must have:
- Unique UTCS anchor ID
- Content hash (SHA-256)
- Version number
- Creation/approval dates
- Upstream/downstream traceability

## Validation

The MoC matrix is validated for:
- [ ] Complete requirement coverage
- [ ] Valid UTCS anchor references
- [ ] Evidence file existence
- [ ] Consistency with compliance checklists
- [ ] No duplicate requirement entries
- [ ] All mandatory fields populated

## Maintenance

The MoC matrix must be updated when:
- New requirements are identified
- Evidence artifacts are created or revised
- EASA provides feedback or Issue Papers
- Compliance status changes

## Traceability

The MoC matrix must:
- Be referenced in all substantiation reports
- Be included in every submission package in `../submissions/`
- Have a corresponding UTCS record in `../utcs/`
- Link to the compliance checklist in `../compliance-checklists/`

## Status

üìã **Ready for artifacts**
