- `{IDX}` = 4-digit serial number (e.g., 0001, 0050, 0125)

Examples:
- `ASM-AAA-ONB-SYS-0001.md` ‚Äî Main landing gear installation sequence

## Installation Sequencing Considerations

### Critical Path Analysis

Systems must be installed in a sequence that minimizes:

1. **Access conflicts**: Heavy/bulky items installed before close-out panels
2. **Rework risk**: Systems with high adjustment needs installed with flexibility for late changes
3. **Testing dependencies**: Systems required for other system tests installed early
4. **Parallel operations**: Independent systems installed simultaneously to reduce cycle time

### Typical Installation Order

For BWB center body (example sequence):

1. **Phase 1 - Major mechanical systems** (landing gear, main ducts)
2. **Phase 2 - Primary electrical harnesses** (main power distribution)
3. **Phase 3 - Hydraulic systems** (pumps, lines, actuators)
4. **Phase 4 - Secondary systems** (ECS components, fuel system details)
5. **Phase 5 - Flight control systems** (actuators, linkages)
6. **Phase 6 - Interior systems** (floors, seats, monuments)
7. **Phase 7 - Close-out and final connections** (panels, access doors)

### Access Gates and Hold Points

Installation sequences define "access gates" - points where panels must remain open for specific system work:

- **Forward access gate**: Open until avionics and flight deck systems complete
- **Center wheel well gate**: Open until landing gear final rigging complete
- **Aft fuselage gate**: Open until APU and tail systems installed
- **Wing root gate**: Open until wing-to-body system connections complete

## Quality and Inspection Requirements

### Pre-Installation Checks

## Interfaces

### Input Interfaces

- **From CAD/ASSY**: System installation envelopes, clearance analysis
- **From System Design**: Interface control documents (ICDs), connector specifications

## Traceability and Evidence

All installation procedures must reference:

1. **Design Authority**: UTCS anchors to approved system designs and specifications
2. **Installation Planning**: UTCS anchors to DMU validation of installation sequence
3. **Process Validation**: UTCS anchors to first article installation reports
4. **Quality Records**: UTCS anchors to inspection and test results

  ‚Üí UTCS-MI:ASM:SYS:ONB:0015:v1  (installation procedure)
  ‚Üí UTCS-MI:CAV:QIP:AAA:SYS-0015:v1  (inspection results)
  ‚Üí UTCS-MI:CAV:TEST:ECS:DUCT-PRESS:v1  (functional test)
```

## Safety Considerations

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

Required PPE varies by system:

- **Electrical work**: Insulated gloves, arc flash protection
- **Hydraulic work**: Chemical-resistant gloves, face shield
- **Fuel systems**: Fire-resistant clothing, respirator
- **Confined spaces**: Harness, air monitoring, communication equipment

## KPIs for System Installation

Tracked via CI/CD pipeline:

- **Installation cycle time**: Target time from major join completion to system functional test
- **First-time-right rate**: Target >90% for system installations without rework

- **Functional test pass rate**: Target >95% on first functional test
- **Safety incidents**: Target 0 incidents per system installation
- **Completeness at gate**: % of planned systems installed by each quality gate

## Coordination and Communication

Weekly installation coordination meetings address:

- **Sequence conflicts**: Resolve access and timing conflicts between disciplines
- **Resource constraints**: Tooling, personnel, and material availability
- **Quality issues**: Address inspection findings and corrective actions
- **Schedule updates**: Track progress against installation plan
- **Lessons learned**: Capture improvements for future installations

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Electrical-to-Hydraulic | Electrical Systems | Hydraulic Systems | Systems Integration Lead |
| Structure-to-System | Structures | Responsible System | AAA Integration Lead |
| System-to-System (mechanical) | Primary System | Secondary System | Systems Integration Lead |
