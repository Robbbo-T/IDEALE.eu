## Crane and Lifting Path Planning

### Objectives

- Define safe crane travel paths for all major component movements

## Reposition Budgets

### Purpose

Reposition budgets track allowable component movements during assembly to maintain dimensional control. Each reposition can introduce positional error that accumulates through the assembly sequence.

### Budget Allocation

| Operation | Translation (mm) | Rotation (degrees) | Cumulative Error (mm) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Initial fixture placement | ¬±2.0 | ¬±0.5 | 2.0 |
| Crane lift and transport | ¬±3.0 | ¬±1.0 | 5.0 |
| Set on assembly jig | ¬±1.5 | ¬±0.3 | 6.5 |
| Adjust for mate | ¬±1.0 | ¬±0.2 | 7.5 |
| Final position (tolerance budget) | --- | --- | ¬±10.0 (spec) |

**Reposition Margin**: 2.5 mm (10.0 - 7.5)

### Reposition Tracking

Each reposition must be documented:

- **What**: Component being moved
- **From/To**: Start and end positions
- **Method**: Crane, AGV, manual, fixture adjustment
- **Accuracy**: Expected positional accuracy of method
- **Cumulative**: Running total of positional uncertainty
- **Mitigation**: Metrology checks, shimming, alignment aids

### Best Practices

- **Minimize repositions**: Plan sequences to reduce component handling
- **Metrology at gates**: Measure actual position after critical repositions
- **Adjust budget**: Update budget based on actual measurements
- **Reserve margin**: Don't consume entire reposition budget, leave margin for adjustments

   - Define worker reach zones (optimal, acceptable, marginal)
   - Optimal: Within 50cm of shoulder, no bending or stretching
   - Acceptable: Requires reaching or slight bending
   - Marginal: Extreme reaches, requires ladders or platforms

2. **Posture Assessment**
   - RULA (Rapid Upper Limb Assessment) for repetitive tasks
   - OWAS (Ovako Working Posture Analysis System) for whole body
   - Identify operations requiring awkward postures
   - Propose workstation modifications or tooling changes

3. **Force Analysis**
   - Measure forces required for tool operation
   - Validate against ergonomic limits (typically <25 lbf / 110 N for extended operations)
   - Consider powered assist for high-force operations

4. **Duration and Frequency**
   - Estimate time spent in each posture
   - Calculate repetition rates for repeated motions
   - Identify operations exceeding fatigue limits

### Ergonomic Solutions
