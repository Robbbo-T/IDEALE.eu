# QIP Hold Points

## Overview

This directory contains Quality Inspection Plan (QIP) hold points, checklists, and acceptance criteria for the **AMPEL360‚ÄëAIR‚ÄëT** BWB aircraft assembly. QIP hold points are critical quality gates where assembly must pause for inspection before proceeding to the next operation, ensuring that defects are caught early and preventing costly rework.

## Purpose

The qip-hold-points directory serves as the central repository for:

- **Inspection hold point definitions** specifying where assembly stops for quality verification
- **Inspection checklists** detailing measurements and checks required at each hold point
- **Acceptance criteria** defining pass/fail limits for inspected features
- **Nonconformance procedures** for handling out-of-specification conditions
- **UTCS traceability** linking inspection results to design requirements and assembly procedures

## Contents Overview

### Hold Point Categories

1. **Pre-Assembly Hold Points**
   - Incoming part inspection and acceptance
   - Fixture calibration verification
   - Tooling and equipment readiness checks
   - Material shelf-life and storage conditions

2. **In-Process Hold Points**
   - Critical dimension verification during assembly
   - Fastener torque audits and witness mark checks
   - Gap measurements at major interfaces
   - Alignment verification before permanent attachment

3. **Post-Assembly Hold Points**
   - Final dimensional inspection
   - Leak testing for sealed compartments
   - Functional testing of installed systems
   - Completeness verification and buy-off

4. **Special Process Hold Points**
   - Sealant application and cure monitoring
   - Bonding process control and validation
   - Non-destructive testing (NDT) inspections
   - Surface treatment and coating verification

## File Naming Convention

Following the canonical naming pattern:

```
QIP-AAA-{ZONE}-{KIND}-{IDX}.{ext}
```

Where:
- `{ZONE}` = `ONB` (onboard/internal) or `OUT` (outboard/external)
- `{KIND}` = Hold point type (e.g., PREASSY, INPROC, POSTASSY, NDT)
- `{IDX}` = 4-digit serial number (e.g., 0001, 0025, 0150)
- `{ext}` = File extension based on content type

Examples:
- `QIP-AAA-ONB-INPROC-0001.md` ‚Äî In-process hold point for wing-to-body join
- `QIP-AAA-ONB-NDT-0012.pdf` ‚Äî NDT inspection requirements for center body welds
- `QIP-AAA-OUT-POSTASSY-0042.csv` ‚Äî Post-assembly inspection checklist for wing panels

## Expected File Types

- `.md` ‚Äî Hold point procedures and inspection instructions
- `.pdf` ‚Äî Formal inspection plans and reports
- `.csv` ‚Äî Inspection checklists and measurement data
- `.json` ‚Äî Metadata, traceability records, acceptance criteria
- `.jpg`, `.png` ‚Äî Reference photos, example defects, measurement locations
- `.xlsx` ‚Äî Inspection data collection forms

## TFA Context

QIP hold points align with the TFA flow: **FE (Functional Execution)**

- **FE**: Quality gates embedded in assembly execution flow ensuring each step meets requirements before proceeding

## Required Artifacts

## Nonconformance Management

### Nonconformance Report (NCR) Process

1. **Identification**
   - Inspection reveals feature out of specification
   - Inspector initiates NCR with unique ID (NCR-AAA-YYYY-NNNN)
   - Part/assembly tagged and segregated

2. **Documentation**
   - Record actual condition vs. specification
   - Include photos, measurements, sketches
   - Identify affected serial numbers and operations
   - Assess severity: Critical / Major / Minor

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Investigate why nonconformance occurred
   - Use 5-Whys, Fishbone diagram, or other RCA methods
   - Identify contributing factors (design, process, material, human, equipment)

4. **Disposition Decision**
   - **Use-As-Is**: Accept as-is with engineering justification (no safety impact)
   - **Repair**: Correct the nonconformance to meet original specification
   - **Rework**: Disassemble and reassemble correctly
   - **Scrap**: Part/assembly cannot be economically corrected

5. **Approval**
   - Use-As-Is requires engineering and certification authority approval
   - Repair/Rework requires quality approval
   - Scrap requires material review board approval

6. **Implementation**
   - Perform approved disposition
   - Re-inspect to verify conformance
   - Update documentation with NCR reference
   - Release for next operation or delivery

7. **Corrective Action**
   - Implement corrective action to prevent recurrence
   - Update procedures, training, tooling as needed
   - Verify effectiveness of corrective action
   - Close NCR in quality system

### NCR Tracking and Trending

- **By Type**: What types of nonconformances are most common?
- **By Location**: Which operations or areas have highest NCR rates?
- **By Root Cause**: What are the systemic issues driving NCRs?
- **By Disposition**: How many require Use-As-Is vs. Rework?
- **By Recurrence**: Are the same issues repeating (ineffective corrective action)?

**Target**: <1% NCR rate, >90% closed within 30 days, zero repeat NCRs

## Inspection Data Management

### Data Collection

- **Real-time entry**: Record measurements immediately during inspection
- **Digital capture**: Use tablets, CMM software, electronic forms
- **Automatic transfer**: Link measurement equipment to quality database

- **Serial number traceability**: Link every measurement to specific part/assembly
- **Version control**: Track changes to inspection procedures and criteria
- **Archival**: Long-term retention per regulatory requirements (typically 25+ years for aerospace)

### Data Analysis

- **Statistical Process Control (SPC)**: Control charts for in-control process monitoring
- **Capability Studies**: Cpk, Ppk to assess process capability vs. requirements
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify drifting processes before nonconformance occurs
- **Correlation Studies**: Compare predicted (stack-up) vs. actual dimensions
