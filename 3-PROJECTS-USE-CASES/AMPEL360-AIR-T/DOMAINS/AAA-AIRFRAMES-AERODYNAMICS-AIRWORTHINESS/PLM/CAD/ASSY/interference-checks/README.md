# Interference Checks for AAA Domain — AMPEL360‑AIR‑T

This folder documents all interference, clash, and minimum‑clearance checks performed on major airframe assemblies and component packaging (**PAx**) within the **AMPEL360‑AIR‑T** Blended Wing Body (BWB) design.

Interference checks are critical for manufacturability and maintainability, ensuring parts can be assembled/removed without physical overlap (**clashes**) or violation of critical spatial boundaries (**clearances**).

---

## Contents Overview

1. **Clash Reports** — Automated exports detailing geometric overlaps between parts in the CAD/DMU.
2. **Minimum Clearance Specifications** — Required gaps around moving parts, HV components, and hot lines (stored in `rules/`).
3. **Digital Mock‑Up (DMU) Verification** — Screenshots and reports confirming that assembly/maintenance paths are clear.

---

## TFA Flow & Assurance

Achieving a clash‑free design in a densely packaged BWB requires continuous verification against evolving geometries and routes. All checks tie into the canonical TFA flow **QS→FWD→UE→FE→CB→QB**.

* **QS** — Global context (geometry revisions, rule sets, environments) threaded via UTCS.
* **FWD** — Predictive models for service difficulty and turn‑time impacts due to access constraints.
* **UE** — Deterministic state capturing clash‑free revisions at specific gates (as‑routed / as‑installed).
* **FE** — Cross‑subsystem coordination for resolving interface conflicts and sequencing mitigations.
* **CB** — Primary enforcement of clearance/kinematic/thermal/EMI rules.
* **QB** — Optional optimization when resolving many conflicts under competing constraints (layout/schedule).

> **Primary loop:** **CB** enforcement producing **UE** snapshots, with **FE** coordination and **FWD** impact assessments.

## Traceability Mandate

All findings, violations, and resolutions must be captured via **UTCS**.

* **UTCS Anchors:** Each clash must anchor the specific geometric versions of colliding parts (e.g., `UTCS-MI:CAD:AAA:PRT:...`) and the assembly config used. All UTCS YAML records for this directory's artifacts are stored in the `./utcs/` subdirectory.
* **Resolution:** Every reported clash links to an approved **ECR**/**Deviation** with decision evidence and mitigations (logged in `resolution-logs/`).
* **No raw paths:** Always use UTCS anchors for CAD/DMU/CAE/QIP artifacts.

---

## Conventions

* **Zones:** `ONB` (onboard/internal) and `OUT` (outboard/skins/LE‑TE/service).

* **File Code Template:** `INT-AAA-{ZONE}-{KIND}-{IDX}`

  * `{ZONE}` ∈ `{ONB|OUT}`
  * `{KIND}` ∈ `{CLASH|CLEAR|KIN|HARNESS|RULE|DMU}`
  * `{IDX}` = 4‑digit serial
  * Examples: `INT-AAA-ONB-CLASH-0038.csv`, `INT-AAA-OUT-KIN-0004.md`

* **Geometry & Evidence:** Reference via UTCS anchors (e.g., `UTCS-MI:CAD:AAA:ASSY:57-10:revC`, `UTCS-MI:CAV:QIP:AAA:INT-0038:v1`).

## Governance & Reviews

* **Approvals:** AAA Integration Lead (design), CAI Lead (integration), QA (evidence/QIP), Safety (operations).
* **Reviews:** Gate at M4 (design freeze); readiness at M5 (pre‑release); delta reviews for late‑stage geometry changes.
* **Change Control:** Updates via PR with UTCS evidence links; CI enforces link/path validation and `INT-AAA` code naming.
