# Resolution Logs — Kinematics/AAA

## Purpose

This folder contains **issue tracking logs with ECR (Engineering Change Request) and Deviation approval references** for all kinematic issues, conflicts, and resolutions for the **AMPEL360‑AIR‑T** airframe.

## Contents

* **Issue logs** — Documented kinematic problems and conflicts
* **Root cause analysis** — Investigation of kinematic failures and violations
* **Resolution actions** — Engineering changes to resolve issues
* **ECR references** — Links to formal engineering change requests
* **Deviation approvals** — Approved deviations from kinematic requirements
* **Verification evidence** — Proof that resolutions are effective

## Naming Convention

Files follow the pattern: `KIN-AAA-RESLOG-{IDX}.md`

* `{IDX}` = 4‑digit serial number (e.g., 0001, 0002, 0003)
* Examples:
  * `KIN-AAA-RESLOG-0001.md` — Landing gear interference resolution
  * `KIN-AAA-RESLOG-0002.md` — Control surface binding issue
  * `KIN-AAA-RESLOG-0003.md` — Door clearance deviation approval

## Issue Categories

### Interference Issues
* **Hard interference** — Physical collision between parts
* **Insufficient clearance** — Clearance below minimum requirements
* **Dynamic interference** — Collision under deflection or tolerances
* **Multi-mechanism conflict** — Interference between multiple moving parts

### Performance Issues
* **Inadequate travel** — Mechanism does not achieve required range of motion
* **Excessive force** — Actuation force exceeds actuator capability
* **Binding** — Mechanism jams or binds during motion
* **Vibration/flutter** — Kinematic mechanism exhibits unwanted dynamics

### Tolerance Issues
* **Stackup violation** — Tolerance accumulation exceeds allowable
* **Assembly variation** — As-built geometry outside acceptable range
* **Wear degradation** — Clearance loss over service life
* **Rigging difficulty** — Mechanism difficult to adjust or maintain

## Resolution Process

1. **Issue identification** — Problem discovered through analysis, test, or inspection
2. **Issue documentation** — Formal issue report with description and evidence
3. **Root cause analysis** — Investigation to determine underlying cause
4. **Resolution options** — Identification of possible solutions
5. **Trade study** — Evaluation of resolution options (cost, schedule, performance)
6. **ECR initiation** — Formal engineering change request if design change required
7. **Deviation request** — Formal deviation if requirement relaxation needed
8. **Implementation** — Execute approved resolution
9. **Verification** — Confirm resolution is effective
10. **Closure** — Document closure with evidence in resolution log

## Resolution Log Format

Each resolution log entry should include:

* **Issue ID** — Unique identifier (e.g., `KIN-AAA-ISS-0001`)
* **Issue Title** — Brief description
* **Discovery Date** — When issue was identified
* **Discovery Method** — Analysis, test, inspection, etc.
* **Severity** — Critical, major, minor
* **Description** — Detailed problem description
* **Root Cause** — Underlying cause of issue
* **Impact** — Effect on aircraft performance, safety, schedule
* **Resolution** — Description of fix or mitigation
* **ECR Reference** — Link to engineering change request (e.g., `ECR-AAA-2025-001`)
* **Deviation Reference** — Link to deviation approval (if applicable)
* **Verification Method** — How resolution effectiveness is verified
* **Verification Evidence** — UTCS link to verification artifacts
* **Status** — Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed
* **Owner** — Responsible engineer
* **Approval** — Approving authority signature/date

## Gate Requirements

* **M3 Gate:** All critical kinematic issues identified and resolution plans approved
* **M4 Gate:** All major kinematic issues resolved and verified
* **M5 Gate:** All kinematic issues resolved or formally deviated

## Cross-References

* **PLM/CAV/QIP** — Quality Issue Protocol for formal issue tracking
* **Change Control** — ECR and deviation approval process
* **Envelopes vs. Structure** — Interference and clearance analysis
* **All kinematic subdirectories** — Issue sources and resolution verification
