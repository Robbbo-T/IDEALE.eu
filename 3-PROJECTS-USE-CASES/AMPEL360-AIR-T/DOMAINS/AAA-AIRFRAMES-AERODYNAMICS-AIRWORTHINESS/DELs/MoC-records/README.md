### Subpart Organization

Within each subpart directory:

```
CS-25-subpart-C/
├── 25.301-loads.txt          # Individual requirement MoC records
├── 25.303-factor-of-safety.txt

```

## Traceability Requirements

### UTCS Integration

Every MoC record must maintain:

- **UTCS_ID Pattern**: `AMPEL360-AIR-T-AAA-MOC-{REQUIREMENT_ID}-{VERSION}`
- **Blockchain Anchoring**: Critical structural and safety compliance records anchored to UTCS
- **Provenance Chain**: Links from requirement through evidence to acceptance
- **Evidence Integrity**: SHA-256 hashes for all referenced evidence files

### Compliance Matrix Linkage

The master compliance matrix (`compliance-matrix.csv`) provides:

| Requirement | Title | Applicability | MoC Method | Status | Evidence | UTCS_ID | EASA Status |
|-------------|-------|---------------|------------|--------|----------|---------|-------------|
| CS-25.301 | Loads | Applicable | A+T | Complete | [Links] | [ID] | Accepted |
| CS-25.303 | Factor of Safety | Applicable | A+I | Complete | [Links] | [ID] | Accepted |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Evidence Cross-References

Each MoC record must reference:

1. **Source Requirements**: `../../PLM/CAO/REQ/` — Original requirement specifications
2. **Analysis Data**: `../../PLM/CAE/` — FEM models, CFD simulations, calculations
3. **Design Data**: `../../PLM/CAD/` — Drawings, 3D models, specifications
4. **Test Data**: `../data-packages/` — Test reports and raw data packages
5. **Summary Reports**: `../final-design-reports/` — Engineering analysis summaries
6. **Submission Packages**: `../EASA-submissions/` — Official regulatory submissions

## Compliance Workflow

### 1. Requirement Analysis

- Review applicable certification specification
- Determine applicability to AMPEL360-AIR-T design
- Select appropriate means of compliance
- Identify required evidence and verification activities

### 2. Evidence Generation

- Conduct analysis using TFA flow (QS → FWD → UE → CB/QB)
- Perform testing and collect data
- Execute design reviews and inspections
- Document similarity arguments

### 3. MoC Record Preparation

- Compile evidence references
- Write compliance demonstration narrative
- Generate UTCS record and metadata
- Calculate evidence package hashes

### 4. Review and Approval

- Technical review by subject matter experts
- Airworthiness review by certification engineers
- Quality assurance verification
- Management approval

### 5. Regulatory Acceptance

- Submit to EASA via `../EASA-submissions/`
- Address any findings or questions
- Obtain formal acceptance
- Update MoC record status

## Quality Assurance

### Verification Checklist

For each MoC record:

- [ ] Requirement correctly identified and transcribed
- [ ] Applicability properly justified
- [ ] Compliance method appropriate and justified
- [ ] All evidence properly referenced with paths and UTCS_IDs
- [ ] Evidence sufficient to demonstrate compliance
- [ ] TFA flow stage documented
- [ ] MAL-EEM checklist completed (if applicable)
- [ ] UTCS record generated and anchored
- [ ] Technical review completed
- [ ] Certification review completed
- [ ] Management approval obtained
- [ ] Status accurately reflects current state

### Audit Requirements

MoC records are subject to:

- **Internal Audits**: Quarterly compliance verification audits
- **Quality System Audits**: Annual ISO 9001 certification audits
- **Certification Authority Audits**: EASA conformity inspections
- **Independent Reviews**: External expert validation (where required)

## Integration with TFA Flow

### TFA Stage Traceability

Each MoC record documents which TFA stage generated the compliance evidence:

- **QS (Quantum State)**: Input state definitions (e.g., load cases, environmental conditions)
- **FWD (Forward Wave Dynamics)**: Predictive analysis outputs (e.g., stress predictions, aerodynamic performance)
- **UE (Unitary Evolution)**: Specific state calculations (e.g., flight condition analysis)
- **FE (Forward Evolution)**: Time-based predictions (e.g., fatigue life, degradation)
- **CB (Classical Bridge)**: Deterministic validation (e.g., physical test correlation)
- **QB (Quantum Bridge)**: Optimization solutions (e.g., topology optimization, weight reduction)

### MAL-EEM Compliance

For requirements involving adaptive or ML-based systems:

- **Ethics**: System design respects human factors and safety
- **Empathy**: User experience and pilot workload considered
- **Explainability**: Decision logic is transparent and auditable
- **Mitigation**: Failure modes identified and mitigated
