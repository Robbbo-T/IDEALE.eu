# EASA Submissions - AAA Domain Deliverables

## Overview

This directory contains specific documents, data packages, and official correspondence submitted to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) or other relevant regulatory bodies for the **AMPEL360-AIR-T** Manned Air platform's Airframes, Aerodynamics, and Airworthiness (**AAA**) domain.

## Purpose

The EASA-submissions directory serves as the central repository for:

- **Certification Application Packages**: Type Certificate (TC) and Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) application submissions
- **Official Correspondence**: Letters, meeting minutes, and formal communications with EASA
- **Technical Data Submissions**: Compliance demonstration reports, test evidence, and analysis documentation
- **Special Conditions**: Proposals and agreements for novel design features requiring special certification conditions
- **Compliance Findings**: Responses to EASA findings, questions, and certification issues
- **Amendment Requests**: Changes to certification basis or previously approved data

## Contents

### Document Categories

1. **Certification Basis Documents**
   - Type Certification Basis (TCB)
   - Certification Programme (CP)
   - Certification Review Items (CRI) lists
   - Issue Papers and Special Conditions proposals

2. **Compliance Demonstration**
   - Compliance Checklists for CS-25 (or applicable standard)
   - Means of Compliance (MoC) descriptions
   - Supporting evidence packages
   - Test reports and analysis summaries

3. **Technical Submissions**

   - Systems architecture documentation
   - Structural analysis reports

4. **Correspondence Records**
   - Official letters to/from EASA
   - Meeting minutes and action items
   - Teleconference records
   - Certification milestone notifications

### Expected File Types

- `.pdf` — Official submission documents, letters, and reports
- `.json` — IDEALE Evidence Framework artifact metadata
- `.xml` — Structured certification data exchange formats
- `.zip` — Consolidated data packages for submission
- `.txt` — Correspondence logs and submission tracking records

## Traceability Requirements

All EASA submissions must maintain:

### UTCS Integration

- **UTCS_ID Pattern**: `AMPEL360-AIR-T-AAA-DEL-EASA-{SEQUENCE}-{VERSION}`
- **Blockchain Anchoring**: All official submissions must be anchored to the UTCS ledger
- **Provenance Chain**: Complete audit trail from source data through submission preparation
- **Content Integrity**: SHA-256 hash verification for all submission packages

### Metadata Requirements

Each submission artifact must include:

```json
{
  "artifact_type": "EASA_Submission",
  "utcs_id": "AMPEL360-AIR-T-AAA-DEL-EASA-{SEQUENCE}-{VERSION}",
  "submission_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "easa_reference": "EASA Reference Number",
  "certification_phase": "TC Application Phase",
  "submission_type": "Compliance Demonstration | Correspondence | Amendment",
  "related_requirements": ["CS-25.XXX", "CS-25.YYY"],
  "tfa_stage": "Forward Wave Dynamics (FWD) | Quantum Bridge (QB) | etc.",
  "mal_eem_status": "Compliant | Not Applicable",
  "reviewer": "EASA Inspector Name",
  "status": "Submitted | Under Review | Accepted | Finding Issued"
}
```

## Submission Workflow

### 1. Preparation Phase

- Gather source data from `PLM/CAE/`, `PLM/CAD/`, and test records
- Compile compliance evidence from `../MoC-records/`
- Generate summary reports from `../final-design-reports/`
- Validate all data against certification requirements

### 2. Internal Review

- Technical review by domain experts
- Quality assurance verification
- MAL-EEM checklist completion (if applicable)
- Management approval

### 3. Package Assembly

- Create consolidated submission package
- Generate artifact metadata and UTCS record
- Calculate content hashes
- Sign with organizational credentials

### 4. Formal Submission

- Submit to EASA via official channels
- Log submission date and reference numbers
- Store acknowledgment receipts
- Update certification tracking system

### 5. Follow-up

- Monitor for EASA questions or findings
- Prepare responses (store in dedicated subdirectories)
- Track resolution of certification issues
- Document final acceptance
