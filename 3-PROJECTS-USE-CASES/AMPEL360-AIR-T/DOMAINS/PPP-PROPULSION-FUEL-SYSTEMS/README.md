# PPP-PROPULSION-FUEL-SYSTEMS

This domain folder contains all technical documentation, models, and compliance evidence related to propulsion systems, engines, fuel systems, and power plant installations for the **AMPEL360-AIR-T** platform.

## 1. Domain Data Layers (PLM Focus)

This domain manages propulsion system design, integration, and certification.

| Layer | Sub-Category | Key Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CAE** | Thermal, Vibration, CFD | Engine thermal analysis, vibration studies, and inlet/exhaust flow simulations. |
| **CAD** | ASSY, PRT, DRW | Geometric definition of engine installations, nacelles, and fuel system routing. |
| **CAV** | CERT, QIP | EASA CS-25 and CS-E compliance for propulsion systems. |
| **CAO** | REQ, CON, SYS | Performance requirements, thrust sizing, and fuel efficiency optimization. |
| **CAS** | SRM, AMM | Engine maintenance manuals and overhaul procedures. |

## 2. TFA Integration

The PPP domain uses TFA flow for propulsion system optimization and performance prediction.

| TFA Component | Role in PPP Domain |
| :--- | :--- |
| **QS** (Input) | Probabilistic space for engine selection, thrust requirements, and fuel configurations. |
| **FWD** (Output) | Forward-looking performance predictions across mission profiles. |
| **UE** (Data Bridge) | Specific engine state (thrust setting, fuel flow, temperature). |
| **CB/QB** (Solver) | **QB** for installation optimization, **CB** for deterministic performance validation. |
| **Traceability** | All engine data indexed via **UTCS** for certification and maintenance tracking. |

## 3. Directory Index

### New ATA Chapter-Based Structure

| Folder | Content Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [`SYSTEMS/`](./SYSTEMS/) | **Primary structure** â€” Organizes propulsion systems by ATA chapter (71-Power Plant, 28-Fuel, etc.). Each system contains complete BEZ (DELs, PAx, PLM, QUANTUM_OA, etc.). See [ATA-STRUCTURE-EXAMPLE.md](../ATA-STRUCTURE-EXAMPLE.md) for details. |
| `domain-config.yaml` | Domain-level configuration file (to be created). |
| `README.md` | This file â€” domain overview and guidance. |
