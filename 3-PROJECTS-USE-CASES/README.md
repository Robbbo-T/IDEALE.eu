# IDEALE.eu Projects and Use Cases (3-PROJECTS-USE-CASES)

This repository section contains the implementation data for all major product lines and strategic use cases, built upon the standardized **Domain â†’ PLM (CAx) â†’ TFA** architecture.

The projects utilize **Quantum-Augmented** capabilities (QAFbW) and adhere strictly to canonical naming and traceability standards.

## Core Architectural Framework

### TFA Canonical Flow (The Quantum Bridge)
The Technology and Functional Architecture (TFA) mandates a sequence that manages the transition from high-dimensional, probabilistic quantum space to classical, deterministic control:

| Stage | Acronym | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| 1 | **QS** | **Quantum Superposition State:** The initial, probabilistic, high-dimensional state space defining all possible solutions and operational scenarios. Used for massive data provenance. |
| 2 | **FWD** | **Forward Wave Dynamics:** The analysis layer responsible for predictability, uncertainty management, and high-level decision framing based on modeling the propagation of possibilities from the QS. |
| 3 | **UE** | **Unit/Unique Element:** The point where the 'wave function collapses.' It represents a specific, verifiable, and deterministic snapshot of a component or system state for classical processing. |
| 4 | **FE** | **Federation Entanglement:** The decision chain mechanism linking and coordinating multiple UEs. Ensures coordinated, traceable decision-making across distributed elements. |
| 5 | **CB** | **Classical Bit / Solver:** The deterministic layer utilizing classical processing and algorithms (e.g., MILP, GA) to enforce known physical constraints. |
| 6 | **QB** | **Qubit Inspired Solver:** The core optimization engine utilizing quantum or quantum-inspired methods (e.g., QUBO, QAOA) to find optimal solutions within the constrained space defined by the CB layer. |
