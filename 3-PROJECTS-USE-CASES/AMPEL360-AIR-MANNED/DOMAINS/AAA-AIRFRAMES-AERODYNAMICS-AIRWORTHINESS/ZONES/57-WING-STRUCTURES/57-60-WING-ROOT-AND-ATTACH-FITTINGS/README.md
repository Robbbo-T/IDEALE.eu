# 57-60-WING-ROOT-AND-ATTACH-FITTINGS â€” Wing Structure Component

**ATA Chapter**: 57 (Wing Structures)  
**Sub-Zone**: 57-60  
**Domain**: AAA (Airframes, Aerodynamics, Airworthiness)  
**Project**: AMPEL360-AIR-MANNED

## Overview

Wing root and attachment fittings transfer all wing loads to the fuselage structure:
- **Wing root fittings** â€” Primary structural joints between wing and fuselage
- **Main attachment lugs** â€” Pinned connections for shear and bending loads
- **Tension/compression fittings** â€” Transfer axial loads from wing box
- **Shear lugs** â€” Vertical and lateral shear load transfer
- **Root rib structure** â€” Heavy-gauge rib at wing-fuselage interface
- **Carry-through structure** â€” Wing box continuation through fuselage
- **Failsafe features** â€” Multiple load paths and crack arresters
- **Inspection provisions** â€” Access for regular structural inspection

These critical fittings must transfer ultimate loads with appropriate factors of safety and provide damage-tolerant, fail-safe design.

## Scope

This sub-zone contains all design, analysis, manufacturing, and certification artifacts for wing root attachment, including:
- Root fitting structural design and sizing
- Lug and pin analysis (bearing, shear, tension)
- Finite element analysis of complex joints
- Fatigue and damage tolerance analysis
- Fail-safe load path verification
- Material specifications for high-strength fittings
- Manufacturing processes (forging, machining, heat treatment)
- Assembly and installation procedures
- Inspection and maintenance requirements

## Key Design Considerations

### Structural Requirements
- **Ultimate load capability**: All limit loads Ã— 1.5 factor of safety
- **Fail-safe design**: Multiple load paths, no single-point failures
- **Fatigue life**: Design service goal plus scatter factors
- **Damage tolerance**: Inspectable, repairable design
- **Static strength**: Adequate margin against yield and ultimate failure

### Fitting Design
- **Lug design**: Proper lug geometry per MIL-HDBK-5 or equivalent
- **Pin design**: Adequate pin diameter and material strength
- **Bushing selection**: Wear-resistant bushings with proper clearances
- **Corrosion protection**: Cadmium plating, anodizing, or coatings
- **Load distribution**: Distribute loads over multiple fittings

### Analysis Requirements
- **Lug analysis**: Bearing, shear, tension, and combined loading
- **Bushing analysis**: Wear life and load capacity
- **Stress concentration**: Finite element analysis of complex geometry
- **Fatigue analysis**: S-N curves, crack initiation and growth
- **Fracture mechanics**: Damage tolerance and inspection intervals

### Material Selection
- **High-strength steel**: 300M, 4340, or custom alloy steel forgings
- **Titanium alloys**: Ti-6Al-4V for weight savings
- **Aluminum forgings**: 7075-T73 for moderate-strength applications
- **Pins and bushings**: Heat-treated steel with surface treatments
- **Corrosion protection**: Cadmium plate, anodize, or protective coatings
