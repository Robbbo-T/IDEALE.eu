# 57-80-FAIRINGS-AND-SEALS â€” Wing Structure Component

**ATA Chapter**: 57 (Wing Structures)  
**Sub-Zone**: 57-80  
**Domain**: AAA (Airframes, Aerodynamics, Airworthiness)  
**Project**: AMPEL360-AIR-MANNED

## Overview

Wing fairings and sealing systems provide aerodynamic efficiency and environmental protection:
- **Wing-fuselage fairings** â€” Aerodynamic blend between wing and fuselage
- **Flap track fairings** â€” Streamlined covers for flap mechanisms
- **Landing gear fairings** â€” Aerodynamic covers for gear doors and wells (if wing-mounted)
- **System fairings** â€” Covers for external equipment and protrusions
- **Sealing systems** â€” Fuel tank sealing, pressure sealing, and weather sealing
- **Gap seals** â€” Minimize air leakage at movable surfaces
- **Drainage provisions** â€” Water drainage from sealed compartments
- **Inspection access** â€” Removable fairings for maintenance access

Fairings reduce parasitic drag while sealing systems prevent fuel leakage, maintain pressure integrity, and protect internal structure from environmental exposure.

## Scope

This sub-zone contains all design, analysis, manufacturing, and certification artifacts for wing fairings and seals, including:
- Fairing aerodynamic design and optimization
- Structural design of fairing supports
- Fuel tank sealant specifications and application
- Pressure seal design for pressurized areas
- Weather sealing for environmental protection
- Gap seal design and installation
- Drainage system design
- Manufacturing processes and materials
- Installation and maintenance procedures

## Key Design Considerations

### Aerodynamic Requirements
- **Drag reduction**: Minimize parasitic drag from discontinuities
- **Smooth transitions**: Blend fairings smoothly with adjacent surfaces
- **Flow management**: Prevent flow separation and turbulence
- **Gap minimization**: Reduce air leakage at gaps and joints
- **Surface quality**: Smooth finish for optimal aerodynamics

### Sealing Requirements
- **Fuel tank sealing**: Prevent fuel leakage from integral tanks
- **Pressure sealing**: Maintain differential pressure (if applicable)
- **Weather sealing**: Prevent water and moisture ingress
- **Environmental sealing**: Protect against dust, sand, and contaminants
- **Drainage**: Adequate drainage of accumulated fluids

### Structural Requirements
- **Support structure**: Adequate stiffness to maintain fairing shape
- **Attachment design**: Quick-release fasteners for maintenance access
- **Load capability**: Withstand aerodynamic and handling loads
- **Vibration resistance**: No resonance or flutter issues
- **Damage tolerance**: Tolerate minor damage without performance loss

### Material Selection
- **Composite fairings**: Fiberglass or carbon fiber for non-structural fairings
- **Aluminum fairings**: Sheet metal for structural fairings
- **Fuel tank sealants**: Polysulfide (PR-1422, PR-1440) or polyurethane sealants
- **Weather seals**: EPDM, silicone, or neoprene rubber seals
- **Gap seals**: Flexible elastomeric seals for movable surfaces

### Maintenance Considerations
- **Accessibility**: Easy removal and installation of fairings
- **Inspection provisions**: Visual inspection of seals and structure
- **Sealant replacement**: Periodic resealing as required
- **Drainage inspection**: Verify drainage paths are clear
- **Corrosion inspection**: Check for moisture damage
