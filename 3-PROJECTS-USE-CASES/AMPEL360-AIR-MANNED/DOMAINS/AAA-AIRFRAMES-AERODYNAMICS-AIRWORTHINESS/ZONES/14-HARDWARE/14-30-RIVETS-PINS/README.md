## TFA Flow

This sub-zone follows the canonical TFA flow:
**QS â†’ FWD â†’ UE â†’ FE â†’ CB â†’ QB**

- **QS** (Quantum Superposition State) â€” Hardware selection exploration
- **FWD** (Forward Wave Dynamics) â€” Application scenario analysis
- **UE** (Unit/Unique Element) â€” Specific hardware specifications
- **FE** (Federation Entanglement) â€” Cross-system hardware coordination
- **CB** (Classical Bit/Solver) â€” Standards compliance verification
- **QB** (Qubit Inspired Solver) â€” Hardware selection optimization

## UTCS Anchors

All artifacts must include UTCS anchors for traceability:
```
