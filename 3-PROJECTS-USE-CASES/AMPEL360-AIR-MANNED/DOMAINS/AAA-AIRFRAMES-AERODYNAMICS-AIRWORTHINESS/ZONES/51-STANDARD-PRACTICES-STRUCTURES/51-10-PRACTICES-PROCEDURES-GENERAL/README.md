# 51-10-PRACTICES-PROCEDURES-GENERAL â€” General Structural Practices and Procedures

**ATA Chapter**: 51 (Standard Practices and Structures)  
**Sub-Zone**: 51-10  
**Domain**: AAA (Airframes, Aerodynamics, Airworthiness)  
**Project**: AMPEL360-AIR-MANNED

## Overview

The general practices and procedures system establishes the fundamental practices for structural design, manufacturing, and maintenance:
- General structural design practices
- Standard procedures and work instructions
- Documentation and reporting requirements
- Quality assurance procedures
- Configuration management practices
- Design review and approval processes
- Change management procedures
- General standards and specifications

## Scope

This sub-zone contains all general practices, procedures, and certification artifacts for structural activities that apply across all structural components.

## UTCS Anchors

All artifacts must include UTCS anchors for traceability:
```
UTCS-MI:DOC:AAA:51-10:PROCEDURES:rev[X]
UTCS-MI:CAE:AAA:51-10:PRACTICES:rev[X]
UTCS-MI:DEL:AAA:51-10:CERT:rev[X]
```

## Status

ðŸš§ **In Development** â€” Structure defined, artifacts to be populated
