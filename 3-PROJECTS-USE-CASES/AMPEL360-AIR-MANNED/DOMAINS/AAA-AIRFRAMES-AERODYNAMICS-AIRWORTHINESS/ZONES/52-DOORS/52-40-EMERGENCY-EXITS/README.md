# 52-40-EMERGENCY-EXITS — Emergency Exits

**ATA Chapter**: 52 (Doors)  
**Sub-Zone**: 52-40  
**Domain**: AAA (Airframes, Aerodynamics, Airworthiness)  
**Project**: AMPEL360-AIR-MANNED

## Overview

The emergency exits system encompasses the structural design and integration of:
- Overwing emergency exits (left and right)
- Emergency exit frame structures
- Quick-release mechanisms (structural interface)
- Exit seal interfaces
- Evacuation provisions
- Emergency egress path integration

## Scope

This zone is organized into specific exit instances, each containing the complete BEZ (Bloque de Estructura Base) structure with all design, analysis, manufacturing, and certification artifacts.

### Sub-Zones

- **52-41-OVERWING-EMERGENCY-EXIT-L** — Left overwing emergency exit
- **52-42-OVERWING-EMERGENCY-EXIT-R** — Right overwing emergency exit

## Key Interfaces

### Structural Interfaces
- **53-XX-FUSELAGE** — Exit frame integration with fuselage structure
- **57-XX-WING** — Overwing exit integration with wing structure
- **51-XX-STANDARDS** — Structural design standards and practices
- **56-XX-WINDOWS** — Adjacent window structures

### Systems Interfaces
- **52-XX-EXIT-OPERATION** (MEC domain) — Quick-release mechanisms
- **25-XX-EQUIPMENT** (CCC domain) — Evacuation slides and equipment
- **33-XX-LIGHTING** (EEE domain) — Emergency exit lighting
- **52-XX-EXIT-WARNING** (CCC domain) — Exit status indicators

## Compliance Requirements

### Certification Standards
- EASA CS-25 (Large Aeroplanes)
  - CS 25.807 — Emergency exits (critical)
  - CS 25.809 — Emergency exit arrangement
  - CS 25.810 — Emergency egress assist means
  - CS 25.811 — Emergency exit marking
  - CS 25.812 — Emergency lighting
  - CS 25.813 — Emergency exit access

### Analysis Requirements
- Emergency evacuation analysis (90-second rule)
- Structural strength analysis (pressure loads, operation loads)
- Quick-release mechanism reliability analysis
- Exit failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA)
- Crash loads and emergency egress analysis
- Passenger flow and evacuation simulation

## TFA Flow

This zone follows the canonical TFA flow:
**QS → FWD → UE → FE → CB → QB**

## UTCS Anchors

All artifacts must include UTCS anchors for traceability. Exit-specific anchors should be under the respective sub-zone (52-41, 52-42):
```
UTCS-MI:CAD:AAA:52-41:EXIT:rev[X]  # Left overwing exit
UTCS-MI:CAD:AAA:52-42:EXIT:rev[X]  # Right overwing exit
```

## Status

✅ **Structure Complete** — Sub-zones defined with full BEZ structure, ready for artifacts
