## TFA Flow

This sub-zone follows the canonical TFA flow:
**QS â†’ FWD â†’ UE â†’ FE â†’ CB â†’ QB**

- **QS** (Quantum Superposition State) â€” Door design space exploration
- **FWD** (Forward Wave Dynamics) â€” Loading scenarios (pressure, crash)
- **UE** (Unit/Unique Element) â€” Specific door component definitions
- **FE** (Federation Entanglement) â€” Interface coordination
- **CB** (Classical Bit/Solver) â€” Structural analysis (FEA)
- **QB** (Qubit Inspired Solver) â€” Door structure optimization

## UTCS Anchors

All artifacts must include UTCS anchors for traceability:
```
UTCS-MI:CAD:AAA:52-10:DOORS:rev[X]
UTCS-MI:CAE:AAA:52-10:STRESS:rev[X]
UTCS-MI:DEL:AAA:52-10:CERT:rev[X]
```

## Status

ðŸš§ **In Development** â€” Structure defined, artifacts to be populated
