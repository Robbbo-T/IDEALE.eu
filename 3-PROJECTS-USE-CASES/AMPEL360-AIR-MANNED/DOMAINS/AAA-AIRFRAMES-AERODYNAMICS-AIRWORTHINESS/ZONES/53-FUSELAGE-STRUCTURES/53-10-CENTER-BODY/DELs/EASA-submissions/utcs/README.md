# UTCS Records

This directory contains UTCS (Universal Traceability and Configuration System) YAML records for all EASA submission packages related to the 53-10 Center Body.

## Purpose

UTCS records provide immutable, blockchain-anchored traceability for certification artifacts, ensuring:
- Complete provenance chain from source data to submission
- Content integrity verification (SHA-256 hashing)
- Version control and configuration management
- Regulatory audit trail
- Evidence linkage across the TFA model (CB â†’ CAV â†’ UE)

## Naming Convention

```
EASA-53-10-SUB-{YYYY}-{SEQ}.yaml
```

Examples:
- `EASA-53-10-SUB-2025-001.yaml`
- `EASA-53-10-SUB-2025-002.yaml`

## UTCS Record Structure

Each YAML file follows the UTCS Canon schema with these key sections:

```

## UTCS ID Format

```
UTCS-MI:DEL:EASA:{ZONE}:SUB:{YYYY}:{SEQ}:v{VERSION}
```

Components:
- **UTCS-MI** â€” UTCS Mission Identifier
- **DEL** â€” Deliverable artifact type
- **EASA** â€” Authority identifier
- **{ZONE}** â€” ATA zone (e.g., 53-10)
- **SUB** â€” Submission type
- **{YYYY}** â€” Year
- **{SEQ}** â€” Sequential number (001, 002, ...)
- **v{VERSION}** â€” Version number

Example: `UTCS-MI:DEL:EASA:53-10:SUB:2025:001:v1`

## Validation

UTCS records are validated for:

### Automated Checks (CI/CD)
- [ ] Schema validation against UTCS v5.0 schema
- [ ] ID uniqueness within repository
- [ ] Hash verification (computed vs. declared)
- [ ] Reference integrity (all anchors exist)
- [ ] Version consistency (semantic versioning)
- [ ] Date logic (modified â‰¥ created)
- [ ] File existence (all referenced files exist)

### Manual Review
- [ ] Traceability completeness
- [ ] Classification accuracy
- [ ] All required approvals obtained
- [ ] Evidence chain is complete
- [ ] CS-25 requirement coverage

## Hash Computation

Generate SHA-256 hashes for all artifacts:

```bash
# Single file hash
sha256sum SUBST-53-10-STATIC-STRENGTH-R01.pdf

# Batch hash computation
find ../substantiation-reports -type f -exec sha256sum {} \; > hashes.txt
```

Include hashes in the `threading.sources_hash` section of the UTCS record.

## Evidence Chain

Each UTCS record must establish a complete evidence chain:

```
Requirements (CS-25.xxx)
    â†“
Analysis (FEM/CAE)
    â†“  UTCS-MI:CAE:AAA:FEM:53-10:xxx
Testing (CAV)
    â†“  UTCS-MI:CAV:TEST:53-10:xxx
Substantiation Reports
    â†“  [files in ../substantiation-reports/]
MoC Matrix
    â†“  [in ../moc-cross-reference/]
Submission Package
    â†“  [in ../submissions/]
UTCS Record
    â†“  UTCS-MI:DEL:EASA:53-10:SUB:2025:xxx
Authority Acceptance
```

## Blockchain Anchoring

Future implementation will include:
- Content hash anchoring on blockchain
- Timestamp proof of artifact existence
- Immutable audit trail
- Smart contract validation
- Tamper detection

## Integration with Evidence Framework

UTCS records integrate with the IDEALE Evidence Framework:

```bash
# Validate UTCS record
python evidence-engine/utcs-validator/validate-utcs.py \
  --record utcs/EASA-53-10-SUB-2025-001.yaml

# Generate UTCS record from submission package
python evidence-engine/utcs-generator/create-utcs-record.py \
  --package ../submissions/EASA-53-10-SUB-2025-001-STATIC-STRENGTH.zip \
  --template easa-submission \
  --output utcs/EASA-53-10-SUB-2025-001.yaml

# Query UTCS database
python evidence-engine/utcs-query/query-utcs.py \
  --utcs-id "UTCS-MI:DEL:EASA:53-10:SUB:2025:001:v1" \
  --format json

# Verify evidence chain
python evidence-engine/utcs-validator/verify-chain.py \
  --start "UTCS-MI:CAE:AAA:FEM:53-10:STATIC:R01" \
  --end "UTCS-MI:DEL:EASA:53-10:SUB:2025:001:v1"
```

## Required UTCS Records

One UTCS record must exist for:
- [ ] Each submission package in `../submissions/`
- [ ] Each major revision of a submission
- [ ] Each resubmission in response to EASA findings

## Lifecycle

1. **Creation** â€” Generated when submission package is prepared
2. **Review** â€” Internal validation and approval
3. **Submission** â€” Package submitted to EASA
4. **Update** â€” Status updated as EASA reviews
5. **Acceptance** â€” Final status when EASA accepts
6. **Archival** â€” Permanent record preservation

## Status Values

- `draft` â€” In preparation
- `in_internal_review` â€” Under internal review
- `approved_for_submission` â€” Ready to submit
- `submitted_to_easa` â€” Submitted to authority
- `under_easa_review` â€” EASA reviewing
- `findings_received` â€” EASA issued findings
- `resubmitted` â€” Updated submission
- `accepted` â€” EASA accepted
- `archived` â€” Final archival

## KPIs

Track via CI/CD pipeline:
- UTCS coverage: % of submissions with UTCS records (target 100%)
- Validation pass rate: % passing CI checks (target 100%)
- Evidence chain completeness: % with full traceability (target 100%)
- Hash consistency: % with valid hashes (target 100%)

## Status

ðŸ“‹ **Ready for UTCS records**
