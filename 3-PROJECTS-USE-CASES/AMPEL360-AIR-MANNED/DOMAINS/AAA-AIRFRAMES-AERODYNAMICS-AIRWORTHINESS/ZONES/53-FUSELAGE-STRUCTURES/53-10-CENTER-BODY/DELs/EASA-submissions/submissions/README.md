## Pre-Submission Validation

Before finalizing a submission package, verify:

- [ ] Cover letter is signed by authorized personnel
- [ ] All required documents are included
- [ ] Document versions match MoC matrix
- [ ] All UTCS anchors are valid and resolvable
- [ ] Content hashes are computed and recorded
- [ ] File naming conventions are followed
- [ ] No placeholder or draft documents remain
- [ ] All cross-references are accurate
- [ ] Compliance checklist is 100% complete
- [ ] Package is reproducible (content â†’ hash â†’ package)

## UTCS Manifest

Each submission package must include a UTCS manifest (`UTCS-MANIFEST.yaml`) containing:

```yaml
submission_id: "EASA-53-10-SUB-2025-001"
package_name: "EASA-53-10-SUB-2025-001-STATIC-STRENGTH.zip"
package_hash: "sha256:abc123..."
created_date: "2025-02-01T12:00:00Z"
authorized_by:
  - name: "Chief of Structures"
  - name: "Head of Airworthiness"

contents:
  - file: "00-COVER-LETTER/EASA-53-10-SUB-2025-001-cover.pdf"
    hash: "sha256:def456..."
    utcs_id: "UTCS-MI:DEL:COVER:53-10:2025-001"
  
  - file: "03-SUBSTANTIATION/SUBST-53-10-STATIC-STRENGTH-R01.pdf"
    hash: "sha256:ghi789..."
    utcs_id: "UTCS-MI:CAE:AAA:FEM:53-10:STATIC:R01"

evidence_chain:
  requirements: ["CS-25.561", "CS-25.571", "CS-25.603"]
  upstream_anchors:
    - "UTCS-MI:CAE:AAA:FEM:53-10:STATIC:R01"
    - "UTCS-MI:CAV:TEST:53-10:DT-COUPON:REP"
```

## Content Hash Verification

Generate and verify content hashes:

```bash
# Generate hash for all files in package
find . -type f -exec sha256sum {} \; > CONTENT-HASH.txt

# Verify package integrity
sha256sum -c CONTENT-HASH.txt
```
