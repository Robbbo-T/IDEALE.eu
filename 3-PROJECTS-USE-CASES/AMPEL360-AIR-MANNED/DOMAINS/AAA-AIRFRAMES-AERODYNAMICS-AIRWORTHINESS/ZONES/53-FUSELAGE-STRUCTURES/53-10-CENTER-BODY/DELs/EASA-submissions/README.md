# EASA Submissions — 53-10 Center Body (ATA 53-10)
**Path:** `3-PROJECTS-USE-CASES/AMPEL360-AIR-MANNED/DOMAINS/AAA-AIRFRAMES-AERODYNAMICS-AIRWORTHINESS/ZONES/53-FUSELAGE-STRUCTURES/53-10-CENTER-BODY/DELs/EASA-submissions/`

This directory contains the formal compliance documentation and technical data packages prepared for **submission to EASA** (or other authorities) for the **53-10 Center Body** of the **AMPEL360-AIR-T** program.  
All artifacts here must be **UTCS-anchored** and traceable to verified evidence (CAE, test, CAV) under the TFA model.

---

## Purpose and Scope
- **Purpose:** assemble certification packages ready for submittal (cover letters, requirement matrices, substantiation reports, test annexes, responses to Issue Papers).
- **Scope:** structural requirements (e.g., **CS-25.561** emergency loads, **CS-25.571** fatigue/DT), lightning/EMI, bonding, tolerances, and *means of compliance* (MoC: analysis/test/inspection).

**TFA / UTCS**
- **CB → CAV → UE:** Structural design & verification (CB) produce CAV evidence that is frozen as **UE** states.
- **QS / UTCS:** Each submittal references immutable versions (hashes) of FEM, reports, and MoC records via **UTCS anchors**.

## Governance Notes

* **Domain authority:** `AAA` (primary for ATA 53).
* **Inheritance:** this directory **instantiates** the domain contract; it does not host global templates.
* **CI/CD checks:** pipeline validates
  1. presence of `utcs/*.yaml` for every item in `submissions/`,
  2. hash consistency,
  3. existence of referenced UTCS anchors.
