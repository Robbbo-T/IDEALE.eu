# AAA Domain ZONES â€” AMPEL360-AIR-MANNED

This directory organizes structural zones according to ATA chapter assignments.

## Structure

Each zone is organized by ATA chapter number and contains sub-zones where the complete BEZ (Bloque de Estructura Base) is applied.

## Zones Defined

### 53-FUSELAGE-STRUCTURES/
**ATA Chapter 53** - Fuselage body structures

Sub-zones:
- `53-10-CENTER-BODY/` â€” Central fuselage section and wing carry-through
- Additional sub-zones to be defined (forward section, aft section, etc.)

### 57-WING-STRUCTURES/
**ATA Chapter 57** - Wing structures and aerodynamic surfaces

Sub-zones:
- `57-10-BOX-SECTION/` â€” Wing box primary structure
- Additional sub-zones to be defined (leading edge, trailing edge, etc.)

## Additional ATA Chapters (To Be Implemented)

According to [ata-chapters.csv](../../../../1-DIMENSIONS/CANONICAL-TAXONOMY/ata-chapters.csv), the AAA domain owns:

- **06** - Dimensions and Stations
- **14** - Hardware (Zones)
- **50** - Cargo and Accessory Compartments
- **51** - Standard Practices and Structures
- **52** - Doors
- **53** - Fuselage âœ“ (implemented)
- **54** - Nacelles/Pylons (shared with PPP)
- **55** - Stabilizers
- **56** - Windows
- **57** - Wings âœ“ (implemented)
- **62** - Main Rotor (helicopters)
- **64** - Tail Rotor (helicopters)
- **65** - Tail Rotor Drive (helicopters)
- **66** - Folding Blades/Pylon

## Sub-Zone Naming Convention

Format: `[ATA]-[SUBSYSTEM-NUMBER]-[DESCRIPTIVE-NAME]/`

Example: `53-10-CENTER-BODY/`

Where:
- `53` = ATA chapter
- `10` = Sub-system identifier (typically increments by 10)
- `CENTER-BODY` = Descriptive name in uppercase with hyphens

## BEZ Structure

Each sub-zone (lowest level) contains the complete BEZ:

```
[SUB-ZONE]/
â”œâ”€ DELs/                   # Deliveries
â”œâ”€ PAx/                    # Packaging (ONB/OUT)
â”œâ”€ PLM/                    # Product Lifecycle Management
â”œâ”€ PROCUREMENT/            # Vendor and component procurement
â”œâ”€ QUANTUM_OA/             # Quantum optimization algorithms
â”œâ”€ SUPPLIERS/              # Supplier bids and services
â”œâ”€ policy/                 # Domain-specific policies
â”œâ”€ tests/                  # Test artifacts and results
â”œâ”€ META.json              # Metadata
â”œâ”€ README.md              # Sub-zone documentation
â””â”€ domain-config.yaml     # Configuration
```
