# QP â€” Quadratic Programming

This directory contains Quadratic programming for nonlinear optimization with quadratic objectives.

## Purpose

The QP optimization approach is used to solve complex design and configuration problems within this sub-zone, including:
- Layout optimization
- Configuration selection
- Resource allocation
- Schedule optimization
- Cost minimization
- Performance maximization

## Contents

Typical artifacts include:
- Optimization model definitions
- Problem formulations
- Solution algorithms and scripts
- Optimization results and reports
- Parameter sensitivity studies
- Trade-off analyses

## Naming Convention

Files should follow the format:
```
QP-[PROBLEM]-[DATE]-[VERSION].[ext]
```

Example: `QP-LAYOUT-OPT-20250127-v1.py`

## Integration

Optimization results integrate with:
- **PLM/CAO/** â€” Design optimization
- **PLM/CAD/** â€” Geometric parameters
- **PLM/CAE/** â€” Performance analysis

## Traceability

All optimization runs must document:
- Input parameters and constraints
- Objective functions
- Solution approach and convergence
- Results and selected configuration
- UTCS anchors for traceability

## Status

ðŸš§ **In Development** â€” Structure ready for optimization studies
