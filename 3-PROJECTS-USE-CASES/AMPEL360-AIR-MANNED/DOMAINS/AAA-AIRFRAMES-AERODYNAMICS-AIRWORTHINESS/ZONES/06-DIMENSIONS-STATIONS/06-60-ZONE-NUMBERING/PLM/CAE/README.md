# CAE â€” Computer-Aided Engineering

This directory contains Engineering analysis including stress, thermal, and performance studies for this sub-zone.

## Purpose

The CAE directory manages all aspects of Engineering analysis including stress, thermal, and performance studies, ensuring proper documentation and traceability throughout the product lifecycle.

## Contents

Typical artifacts include:
- Finite element models (.fem, .inp)
- Analysis results and reports
- Load case definitions
- Structural analysis results
- Thermal analysis results
- Performance analysis data

## Naming Convention

Files should follow the format:
```
CAE-[ATA]-[COMPONENT]-[TYPE]-[VERSION].[ext]
```

Example: `CAE-06-DATUM-DEFINITION-v1.pdf`

## UTCS Integration

All artifacts must include UTCS anchors:
```
UTCS-MI:CAE:AAA:06-XX:[ARTIFACT]:rev[X]
```

## Key Interfaces

- **DELs/** â€” Certification deliverables
- **Other PLM directories** â€” Cross-functional coordination
- **SUPPLIERS/** â€” Vendor data integration

## Status

ðŸš§ **In Development** â€” Structure ready for artifact population
