# PAx/OUT â€” External Systems Integration

This directory contains packaging and integration artifacts for **external systems** within this sub-zone.

## Purpose

The OUT (Outboard/External) directory manages integration of systems and components that are installed on the aircraft's external structure, including:
- External equipment mounting
- External surface installations
- Leading edge and trailing edge systems
- External access panels and doors
- External service connections
- Aerodynamic fairing integration

## Contents

Typical artifacts include:
- External mounting designs
- Aerodynamic integration studies
- External access procedures
- Service interface specifications
- External systems coordination
- Environmental protection requirements

## Naming Convention

Files should follow the format:
```
PAx-OUT-[SYSTEM]-[TYPE]-[VERSION].[ext]
```

Example: `PAx-OUT-EXTERNAL-PANEL-LAYOUT-v1.pdf`

## Key Interfaces

- **PLM/CAD/** â€” External geometry models
- **PLM/CAE/** â€” Aerodynamic analysis
- **06-30-EXTERNAL-ENVELOPE/** â€” External boundaries

## Traceability

All artifacts must include UTCS anchors for configuration management and traceability.

## Status

ðŸš§ **In Development** â€” Structure ready for artifact population
