# Deliverables (DELs) for AAA Domain - AMPEL360-AIR-T

This directory contains the formal deliverables, mandated reports, and critical compliance documentation specific to the Airframes, Aerodynamics, and Airworthiness (**AAA**) domain for the **AMPEL360-AIR-T** Manned Air platform.

These artifacts serve as the final evidence required by regulatory bodies (e.g., EASA) and internal program management to demonstrate compliance and successful completion of key lifecycle phases (PDR, CDR, Type Certification).

## Contents Overview

Deliverables stored here typically include:

1.  **Certification Documentation:** Final submissions of the Compliance Matrix, Means of Compliance (MoC) evidence, and official correspondence with regulatory authorities.
2.  **Summary Reports:** Final, approved reports derived from raw data in the `tests/` and `PLM/CAE/` folders (e.g., Final Stress Analysis Report, Flutter Clearance Report, Acoustic Test Summary).
3.  **Master Technical Specifications:** The finalized versions of component specifications and assembly master plans (often linked to `PLM/CAD/DRW`).
4.  **Airworthiness Compliance Records:** Auditable records proving that all parts and processes adhere to the required standards (indexed via **UTCS**).

## Traceability Mandate

Every file within this directory must be indexed by the **UTCS** system, mapping it directly back to the foundational safety and performance requirements established in `PLM/CAO/REQ/`.

*   **Required Metadata:** Each deliverable must reference its generating **TFA Flow** stage and carry a complete **UTCS record**.
*   **Compliance:** Critical structural and safety deliverables must confirm adherence to the **MAL-EEM** checklist (Ethics/Empathy/Explainability/Mitigation), particularly for any adaptive aerodynamic control systems.
