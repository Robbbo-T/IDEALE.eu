# Airworthiness Statements - AAA Domain Deliverables

## Overview

This directory contains official statements affirming the airworthiness status of major airframe assemblies and systems for the **AMPEL360-AIR-T** Manned Air platform's Airframes, Aerodynamics, and Airworthiness (**AAA**) domain.

These statements are formal declarations that specific aircraft components, assemblies, or systems meet all applicable regulatory requirements and are fit for safe operation.

- **Component Conformity Statements**: Statements affirming individual components meet specifications
- **Type Certification Evidence**: Supporting documentation for Type Certificate application
- **Continued Airworthiness Statements**: Declarations supporting in-service airworthiness
- **Special Condition Compliance**: Statements addressing novel design features
