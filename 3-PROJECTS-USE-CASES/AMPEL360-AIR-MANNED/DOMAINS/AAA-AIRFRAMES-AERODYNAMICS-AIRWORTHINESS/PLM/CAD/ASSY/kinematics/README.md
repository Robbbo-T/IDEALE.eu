# Kinematics for AAA Domain ‚Äî AMPEL360‚ÄëAIR‚ÄëT

This folder contains models, analysis results, and design documentation defining the motion, range of travel, and mechanical constraints (**kinematics**) of moving assemblies within the **AMPEL360‚ÄëAIR‚ÄëT** airframe.

Scope includes flight control surfaces (flaps, spoilers, ailerons, rudder/elevons), landing‚Äëgear mechanisms, doors, and movable fairings. Kinematic feasibility is verified against the geometric envelope and actuator specifications, with strong coupling to **PAx** (clearances/routes) and **Interference** checks.

---

## Contents Overview

1. **Motion Studies** ‚Äî CAD/MBD simulation paths and velocity profiles for moving parts.
2. **Range of Motion (ROM) Reports** ‚Äî Evidence that required travel angles/lengths are met without lockup or overstress.
3. **Boundary Definitions** ‚Äî Mathematical travel limits and joint constraints (hard/soft stops, stiffness, backlash).
4. **Actuator Interfaces** ‚Äî Input/output travel, force/torque profiles and timing vs. system performance.
5. **Kinematic Envelopes ‚Üî Structure** ‚Äî Clearance margins across motion against PAx geometry and INT rules.

## TFA Flow & Verification

Kinematic verification is integrated in the canonical TFA flow **QS‚ÜíFWD‚ÜíUE‚ÜíFE‚ÜíCB‚ÜíQB**:

* **QS** ‚Äî Global context: geometry revs, actuator specs, environmental conditions; threaded via UTCS.
* **FWD** ‚Äî Aircraft response envelopes and safe operating regions using kinematic models as inputs.
* **UE** ‚Äî Approved, deterministic kinematic snapshots (as‚Äëmodeled / as‚Äëvalidated) at design gates.
* **FE** ‚Äî Coordination across subsystems (e.g., control‚Äësurface availability vs. system installs and access).
* **CB** ‚Äî Enforcement of geometric/kinematic constraints, joint limits, and INT/PAx clearance rules during simulation.
* **QB** ‚Äî Optional optimization for schedule/sequence or parameter sweeps (e.g., minimizing actuation time under constraints).

> **Primary loop for verification:** **CB** (constraint simulation) ‚Üí **UE** (snapshot) with **FWD** assessment and **FE** coordination.

## Traceability Mandate

All kinematic models and reports must maintain traceability to driving requirements (e.g., max deflection for takeoff/landing) and to the exact geometry and actuator revisions used.

* **UTCS Anchors:** Link all motion models to **MBD/CAD** via UTCS. All UTCS YAML records for this directory's artifacts are stored in the `./utcs/` subdirectory.
* **Compliance:** Failures (binding/overlap/limit violations) must be resolved and logged in a **resolution log** with ECR/Deviation references before M4/M5 gates.
* **No raw paths:** Use UTCS‚ÄëMI anchors for all referenced artifacts.

---

## Conventions

* **Zones:** `ONB` (onboard/internal) and `OUT` (outboard/skins/LE‚ÄëTE/service).

* **File Code Template:** `KIN-AAA-{ZONE}-{KIND}-{IDX}`

  * `{ZONE}` ‚àà `{ONB|OUT}`
  * `{KIND}` ‚àà `{SURF|GEAR|DOOR|JOINT|ACT|ROM|MBD}`
  * `{IDX}` = 4‚Äëdigit serial
  * Example: `KIN-AAA-OUT-SURF-0001.md` (outboard control‚Äësurface kinematics #1)

* **Geometry & Evidence:** Reference via UTCS anchors (e.g., `UTCS-MI:CAE:MBD:AAA:GEAR-MAIN:v2`, `UTCS-MI:CAV:QIP:AAA:KIN-0001:v1`).

## Governance & Reviews

* **Approvals:** AAA Integration Lead (design), MBD Lead (simulation), QA (evidence/QIP), Safety (ops).
* **Reviews:** Gate at M3 (functional reach), M4 (design freeze), M5 (release); delta reviews on geometry/systems updates.
* **Change Control:** PRs must include UTCS evidence links; CI enforces link/path validation and `KIN-AAA` code naming.
