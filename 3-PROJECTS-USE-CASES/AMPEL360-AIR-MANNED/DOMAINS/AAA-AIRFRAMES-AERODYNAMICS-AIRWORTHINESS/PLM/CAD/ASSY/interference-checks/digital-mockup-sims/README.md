# Digital Mock-Up Simulations â€” Interference Checks

This folder contains DMU (Digital Mock-Up) verification packages including videos, animations, and snapshot packs that confirm assembly/maintenance paths are clear and interference-free.

---

## Purpose

DMU simulations provide visual verification that designs meet manufacturing and maintenance requirements. These simulations validate assembly sequences, tool clearances, maintenance access, and part removal/installation procedures before physical prototyping.

---

## Contents

* **Assembly sequence animations** (video walkthroughs)
* **Maintenance access simulations** (tool clearance, reach envelopes)
* **Part removal/installation animations**
* **DMU verification snapshot packs** (critical positions documented)
* **Human factors simulations** (mechanic reach, visibility, ergonomics)
* **Tooling clearance verification**

---

## Naming Convention

Files follow the template: `INT-AAA-{ZONE}-DMU-{IDX}.{ext}`

* `{ZONE}` âˆˆ `{ONB|OUT}`
* `{IDX}` = 4â€‘digit serial (e.g., `0001`, `0042`)
* `{ext}` âˆˆ `{md|mp4|avi|png|pdf|zip}`

**Examples:**
* `INT-AAA-ONB-DMU-0003.mp4` â€” Engine removal sequence
* `INT-AAA-OUT-DMU-0011.zip` â€” Wing panel access snapshots
* `INT-AAA-ONB-DMU-0007.pdf` â€” Maintenance tooling clearance report

---

## Required Content

Each DMU package must include:

* **UTCS Anchor**: Assembly configuration and component revisions
* **Simulation Type**: Assembly, disassembly, maintenance, inspection
* **Tool Requirements**: Special tools, fixtures, stands
* **Access Requirements**: Panel removal sequence, clearance needs
* **Human Factors**: Ergonomics, visibility, reach zones
* **Critical Clearances**: Minimum gaps verified during motion
* **Assembly Time Estimate**: Labor hours and complexity rating
* **Approval Status**: Design review sign-off

---

## DMU Scenarios

### Assembly Verification
* Major section join operations
* Systems installation sequences
* Interior fit-up procedures

### Maintenance Access
* LRU (Line Replaceable Unit) removal/installation
* Inspection access requirements
* Service panel locations

### Manufacturing
* Tooling clearances during fabrication
* Jig and fixture interference
* Transportation and handling envelopes

## TFA Stage

**UE** (deterministic state capture) â†’ **FE** (cross-functional validation)

DMU packages represent **UE** snapshots that have been validated through **FE** coordination with manufacturing and maintenance teams.

---

## Deliverable Formats

* **Videos**: MP4, AVI (720p minimum, H.264 codec)
* **Snapshots**: PNG, JPEG (1920Ã—1080 minimum)
* **Reports**: PDF with embedded images
* **Archives**: ZIP containing complete verification package

---

## KPIs

* **Coverage**: % of major assemblies with DMU verification
* **Access compliance**: % of maintenance points verified
* **Assembly sequence conflicts**: Count and resolution status

---

## Status

ðŸ”„ **In Progress** â€” Landing gear DMU underway
