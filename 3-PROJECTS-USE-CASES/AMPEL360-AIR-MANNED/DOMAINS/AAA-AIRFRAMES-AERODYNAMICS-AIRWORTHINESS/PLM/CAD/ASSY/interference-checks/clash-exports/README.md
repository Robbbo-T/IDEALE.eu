# Clash Exports â€” Interference Checks

This folder contains raw data dumps and visualizations from automated clash detection tools for the **AMPEL360â€‘AIRâ€‘T** BWB design.

---

## Purpose

Clash exports provide the foundational geometric interference data that drives resolution activities. These exports are generated by CAD/DMU tools (e.g., CATIA, Siemens NX, 3DEXPERIENCE) and contain detailed information about part-to-part overlaps.

---

## Contents

* **Zone-specific clash exports** (`ONB` and `OUT`)
* **Automated clash detection reports** (CSV, XML, HTML)
* **Visual clash overlays** (screenshots, annotated PDFs)
* **Batch export logs** from DMU validation runs

---

## Naming Convention

Files follow the template: `INT-AAA-{ZONE}-CLASH-{IDX}.{ext}`

* `{ZONE}` âˆˆ `{ONB|OUT}`
* `{IDX}` = 4â€‘digit serial (e.g., `0001`, `0038`)
* `{ext}` âˆˆ `{csv|xml|html|pdf|png}`

**Examples:**
* `INT-AAA-ONB-CLASH-0001.csv`
* `INT-AAA-OUT-CLASH-0042.pdf`

---

## Required Metadata

Each clash export must include:

* **UTCS Anchor**: Geometric revision IDs for all clashing parts
* **CAD Tool & Version**: Source system used for detection
* **Detection Rules**: Clearance thresholds applied
* **Timestamp**: When the analysis was performed
* **Assembly Configuration**: Base configuration ID

---

## TFA Stage

**CB** (Constraint-Based enforcement) â†’ **UE** (Uncertainty Elimination)

Clash exports feed directly into **CB** validation and produce deterministic **UE** snapshots at design gates.

---

## Status

ðŸ”„ **In Progress** â€” Awaiting automated CI integration
