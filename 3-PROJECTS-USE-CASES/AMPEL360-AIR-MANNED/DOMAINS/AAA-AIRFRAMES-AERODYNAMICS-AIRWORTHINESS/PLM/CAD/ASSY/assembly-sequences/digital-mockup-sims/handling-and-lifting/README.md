# Handling and Lifting â€” Sub-Assemblies

This directory contains documentation for **fixture reach, sling data, COG tables, and orientation limits** for sub-assemblies belonging to the AAA Domain of **AMPEL360â€‘AIRâ€‘T**.

## Purpose

Proper handling and lifting procedures are critical for safety and preventing damage to aircraft structures during manufacturing, assembly, and maintenance operations. This folder manages:

* Lifting fixture designs and specifications
* Sling attachment point locations and load ratings
* Center of Gravity (COG) calculations for various assembly states
* Permissible orientation limits during handling
* Transportation and storage requirements

## Contents

* **Lifting Plans** â€” Detailed procedures for lifting each sub-assembly
* **COG Tables** â€” Center of gravity data for different configurations
* **Fixture Drawings** â€” CAD models and drawings of specialized lifting fixtures
* **Load Calculations** â€” Structural verification of lifting points
* **Safety Requirements** â€” Personnel safety and structural protection guidelines

## Naming Convention

Files follow the template: `HANDLE-AAA-{MODULE}-{IDX}.{ext}`

* `{MODULE}` âˆˆ `{WINGBOX|STAB|FUSE|LGBAY|PYLON}`
* `{IDX}` = 3â€‘digit serial (e.g., `001`, `002`)
* `{ext}` âˆˆ `{md|pdf|xlsx|dwg}`

**Examples:**
* `HANDLE-AAA-WINGBOX-001.pdf` â€” Wing box lifting procedure
* `HANDLE-AAA-FUSE-002.xlsx` â€” Fuselage section COG table
* `HANDLE-AAA-STAB-001.md` â€” Stabilizer handling requirements

## TFA Context

* **Primary Loop:** FEâ†’CB
* **UTCS Anchors:** `UTCS-MI:SUB:HANDLE:{MODULE}-{IDX}:v1`
* **Domain:** AAA (Airframes, Aerodynamics, Airworthiness)
* **Safety Critical:** All procedures require safety review and approval

## Required Information

Each handling plan must include:

1. **Weight and COG Data**
   - Total assembly weight
   - Center of gravity location (X, Y, Z coordinates)
   - COG variations for different component states

2. **Lifting Point Specifications**
   - Attachment point locations
   - Load ratings and safety factors
   - Structural verification references

3. **Fixture Requirements**
   - Special tools and equipment needed
   - Fixture installation procedures
   - Inspection requirements

4. **Orientation Limits**
   - Maximum tilt angles
   - Prohibited orientations
   - Stability requirements

5. **Safety Precautions**
   - Personnel clearance zones
   - Ground support equipment requirements
   - Emergency procedures
