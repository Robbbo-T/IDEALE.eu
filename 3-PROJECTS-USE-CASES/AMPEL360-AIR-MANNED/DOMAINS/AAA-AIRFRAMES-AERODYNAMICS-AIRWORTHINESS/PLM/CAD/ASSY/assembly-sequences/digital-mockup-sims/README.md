## Best Practices

### Model Management

- Use lightweight representations for large assemblies to improve performance
- Maintain separate simplified models for clearance checking
- Document all geometry simplifications and their impact on results
- Version control DMU assemblies synchronized with CAD baselines

### Collision Detection Settings

- Set appropriate collision detection resolution (balance accuracy vs. performance)
- Define clearance zones around components for near-miss detection
- Use bounding boxes for initial coarse collision checks
- Refine with precise mesh-based checks in critical areas

### Animation Quality

- Use smooth camera movements for viewer comprehension
- Add annotations and callouts for key assembly features
- Include assembly step numbers and component labels
- Show multiple viewing angles for complex operations
- Maintain consistent timing (not too fast or too slow)

### Performance Optimization

- Suppress non-essential components from collision detection
- Use envelopes or simplified geometry where appropriate
- Run simulations overnight for complex assemblies
