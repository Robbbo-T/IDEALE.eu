# Bills of Materials (BOM) â€” Sub-Assemblies

This directory contains **module BOMs (Engineering BOM/Assembly BOM) and component extracts** for sub-assemblies belonging to the AAA Domain of **AMPEL360â€‘AIRâ€‘T**.

## Purpose

Bills of Materials provide structured lists of all components, parts, and materials required to manufacture and assemble each sub-assembly. BOMs are essential for:

* Manufacturing planning and procurement
* Cost estimation and tracking
* Configuration management
* Traceability and compliance
* Maintenance planning

## Contents

* **Engineering BOMs (EBOM)** â€” Design-centric view organized by function
* **Assembly BOMs (ABOM)** â€” Manufacturing-centric view organized by assembly sequence
* **Component Extracts** â€” Detailed part lists for specific modules
* **Material Specifications** â€” Raw material and standard parts
* **Change History** â€” BOM evolution and effectivity tracking

## Naming Convention

Files follow the template: `BOM-AAA-{MODULE}-{IDX}.{ext}`

* `{MODULE}` âˆˆ `{WINGBOX|STAB|FUSE|LGBAY|PYLON|RIB|SPAR|PANEL}`
* `{IDX}` = 3â€‘digit serial (e.g., `001`, `002`)
* `{ext}` âˆˆ `{csv|xlsx|xml|pdf}`

**Examples:**
* `BOM-AAA-WINGBOX-001.xlsx` â€” Wing box complete BOM
* `BOM-AAA-FUSE-002.csv` â€” Fuselage section BOM extract
* `BOM-AAA-STAB-001.pdf` â€” Stabilizer assembly BOM with drawings

## TFA Context

* **Primary Loop:** QSâ†’UE
* **UTCS Anchors:** `UTCS-MI:BOM:AAA:{MODULE}-{IDX}:v1`
* **Domain:** AAA (Airframes, Aerodynamics, Airworthiness)
* **Configuration Control:** BOMs are configuration items requiring formal change control

## BOM Structure

### Engineering BOM (EBOM)
Organized by design function and component hierarchy:

```
Sub-Assembly (e.g., SA-AAA-WINGBOX-001)
â”œâ”€â”€ Primary Structure
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Spars
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Front Spar (Part Number, Qty, Material)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Rear Spar
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Ribs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Skin Panels
â”œâ”€â”€ Fasteners
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Hi-Lok Bolts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Rivets
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Nuts/Washers
â””â”€â”€ Sealants & Coatings
    â”œâ”€â”€ Fuel Sealant
    â””â”€â”€ Corrosion Protection
```

### Assembly BOM (ABOM)
Organized by manufacturing/assembly sequence:

```
Assembly Sequence
â”œâ”€â”€ Step 1: Jig Setup
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Tooling (not part of final assembly)
â”œâ”€â”€ Step 2: Spar Installation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Front Spar + Fasteners
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Rear Spar + Fasteners
â”œâ”€â”€ Step 3: Rib Installation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Ribs + Fasteners
â””â”€â”€ Step 4: Skin Panel Installation
    â””â”€â”€ Panels + Fasteners + Sealant
```

## Required Information

Each BOM entry must include:

1. **Part Identification**
   - Part Number (unique identifier)
   - Part Name/Description
   - Revision/Version
   - Drawing Reference

2. **Quantity and Units**
   - Quantity per assembly
   - Unit of measure (EA, KG, M, L)
   - Scrap/attrition allowance

3. **Classification**
   - Make/Buy designation
   - Standard/Custom part
   - Criticality level (safety critical, flight essential, etc.)
   - Source control drawing (if applicable)

4. **Material Specification**
   - Material type and grade
   - Heat treatment requirements
   - Surface finish/coating
   - Material certification requirements

5. **Procurement Information**
   - Lead time
   - Preferred supplier(s)
   - Alternate sources
   - Cost estimate

6. **Configuration Data**
   - Effectivity (applies to which aircraft)
   - Interchangeability group
   - Supersession information
   - Change history

## BOM Types

### Top-Level Assembly BOM
* Complete sub-assembly with all child components
* Includes purchased assemblies and fabricated parts
* Links to lower-level BOMs

### Fabrication BOM
* Raw materials and processes to create a part
* Machine time, labor hours
* Consumables (cutting fluids, abrasives, etc.)

### Installation BOM
* Parts needed for installation at assembly station
* Includes installation aids, sealants, lubricants
* Does not include tooling (tracked separately)

## BOM Management

### Version Control
* All BOMs are version controlled
* Changes tracked via Engineering Change Requests (ECRs)
* Effectivity dates and serial number applicability

### Approval Process
1. **Engineer** â€” Creates/updates BOM
2. **Lead Engineer** â€” Technical review
3. **Manufacturing** â€” Feasibility review
4. **Procurement** â€” Availability and cost review
5. **Quality** â€” Compliance verification
6. **Configuration Management** â€” Release approval

### Integration with PLM System
* BOMs synchronized with PLM database
* Automated BOM generation from CAD assemblies
* Real-time updates to manufacturing and procurement
