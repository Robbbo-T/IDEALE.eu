# AAP — Airport Adaptable Platforms

**Domain:** Airport Adaptable Platforms  
**Code:** AAP  
**Project:** AMPEL360-AIR-MANNED

## Overview

The AAP domain manages all ground handling, parking, mooring, and airport interface systems for the aircraft. This domain ensures safe and efficient aircraft operations on the ground, including static positioning, securing, and platform adaptability.

## Scope

- Ground handling equipment interfaces
- Parking and mooring systems (ATA 10)
- Airport platform adaptation
- Ground service point interfaces
- Towing and positioning systems

## ATA Chapter Assignments

### Primary Chapters
- **10** - Parking and Mooring

### Secondary Involvement
- 09 (Towing) - coordination with DDD domain
- Ground support interfaces with IIS domain

## Cross-Domain Dependencies

| Depends On | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| **AAA** | Structural attachment points for mooring |
| **DDD** | Drainage during ground operations |
| **IIS** | Ground support equipment data systems |
| **LIB** | Ground servicing logistics |

## Interfaces

- **AAA**: Fuselage attachment points, landing gear interfaces
- **IIS**: Ground support equipment data exchange
- **LIB**: Servicing schedules and logistics
- **DDD**: Water drainage and de-icing on ground

## Key Systems

### 10-PARKING-MOORING
- Mooring points and tie-down systems
- Chocks and parking equipment
- Ground positioning systems
- Static stability on platforms

## Compliance & Standards

- **ATA iSpec 2200**: Chapter 10 specifications
- **IATA Ground Operations Manual (IGOM)**
- **Airport ground handling standards**
- **FAA/EASA** ground operations requirements

## Status

🏗️ **Active Development** — BEZ structure complete, awaiting artifact population
