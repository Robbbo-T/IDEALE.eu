# MEC Domain SYSTEMS â€” AMPEL360-AIR-MANNED

This directory organizes mechanical systems and modules according to ATA chapter assignments.

## Structure

Each system is organized by ATA chapter number and contains the complete BEZ (Bloque de Estructura Base) at the system level.

## Systems Defined

### 32-LANDING-GEAR-SYSTEMS/
**ATA Chapter 32** - Landing Gear

Directory structure created, ready for BEZ implementation.

## ATA Chapter Assignments for MEC Domain

According to [ata-chapters.csv](../../../../1-DIMENSIONS/CANONICAL-TAXONOMY/ata-chapters.csv), the MEC domain owns:

- **27** - Flight Controls (control surfaces and linkages)
- **29** - Hydraulic Power
- **32** - Landing Gear âœ“ (structure created)
- **36** - Pneumatic (air bleed)
- **37** - Vacuum (instrumental pressure)
- **63** - Main Rotor Drive (helicopters)
- **67** - Rotors Flight Control (helicopters)
- **79** - Oil (engine lubrication)
- **83** - Accessory Gearboxes
