## Overview

**MAP-CCC** orchestrates management and planning services for the **CCC (Cockpit, Cabin, Cargo)** domain within ASI-T2-INTELLIGENCE.

### Purpose

- **Domain Coordination**: Orchestrate CCC domain activities across the TFA flow
- **Interior Design**: Manage cockpit layout, cabin configuration, cargo systems
- **Passenger Experience**: Optimize comfort, accessibility, entertainment
- **Operational Efficiency**: Maximize payload capacity and flexibility

---

## Domain Scope

**CCC** covers:
- **Cockpit**: Flight deck layout, instruments, controls, crew stations
- **Cabin**: Seating, galleys, lavatories, lighting, IFEC (in-flight entertainment)
- **Cargo**: Cargo holds, loading systems, restraint systems, accessibility
