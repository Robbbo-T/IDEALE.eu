## Overview

**MAP-AAA** orchestrates management and planning services for the **AAA (Airframes, Aerodynamics, Airworthiness)** domain within ASI-T2-INTELLIGENCE.

### Purpose

- **Domain Coordination**: Orchestrate AAA domain activities across the TFA flow
- **Requirements Management**: Track airframe requirements and specifications
- **Certification Planning**: Manage CS-25/FAR-25 compliance activities
- **Resource Allocation**: Coordinate teams, tools, and facilities

---

## Domain Scope

**AAA** covers:
- **Airframe Structures**: Fuselage, wings, empennage, landing gear
- **Aerodynamics**: CFD analysis, wind tunnel testing, performance prediction
- **Airworthiness**: Certification basis, compliance demonstration, type certificate

## Integration with TFA Flow

MAP-AAA orchestrates domain activities through the full TFA cycle:

| TFA Stage | AAA Activities |
| :--- | :--- |
| **QS** | Explore airframe configurations, material options, structural concepts |
| **FWD** | Predict structural fatigue, aerodynamic performance, certification timeline |
| **UE** | Capture design snapshots, as-built configurations, test article states |
| **FE** | Coordinate with PPP (propulsion integration), CCC (cabin integration) |
| **CB** | Validate against CS-25 requirements, structural limits, aero constraints |
| **QB** | Optimize weight, aerodynamic efficiency, structural topology |
