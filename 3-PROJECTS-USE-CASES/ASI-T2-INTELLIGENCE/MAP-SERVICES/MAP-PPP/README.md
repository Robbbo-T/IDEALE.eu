## Overview

**MAP-PPP** orchestrates management and planning services for the **PPP (Propulsion, Fuel Systems)** domain within ASI-T2-INTELLIGENCE.

### Purpose

- **Domain Coordination**: Orchestrate PPP domain activities across the TFA flow
- **Propulsion Integration**: Manage engine and fuel system integration
- **Performance Management**: Track thrust, fuel consumption, emissions
- **Technology Management**: Coordinate H₂ hybrid-electric systems

---

## Domain Scope

**PPP** covers:
- **Engines**: Turbofans, turboprops, electric motors, hybrid systems
- **Fuel Systems**: Tanks, pumps, distribution, H₂ cryogenic storage
- **Exhaust Systems**: Nozzles, thrust reversers, emission control
- **Powerplant Integration**: Nacelles, pylons, engine mounts
