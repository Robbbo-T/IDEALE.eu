## Overview

**MAP-LCC** orchestrates management and planning services for the **LCC (Linkages Control Communications)** domain within ASI-T2-INTELLIGENCE.

### Purpose

- **Domain Coordination**: Orchestrate LCC domain activities across the TFA flow
- **Requirements Management**: Track linkages control communications requirements and specifications
- **Resource Allocation**: Coordinate teams, tools, and facilities
- **Integration Management**: Coordinate interfaces with other domains
