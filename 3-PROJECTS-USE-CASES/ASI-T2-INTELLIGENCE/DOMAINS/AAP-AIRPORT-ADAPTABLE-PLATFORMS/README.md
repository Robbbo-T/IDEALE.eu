## QUANTUM_OA — Problems ⇄ Formulations ⇄ Algorithms

This domain addresses operational optimization through quantum-inspired methods. Below are specific problems, their formulations, applicable algorithms, and tractability metrics.

| Specific Problem | Typical Formulation | Algorithm(s) | Minimum Inputs | Outputs | Key Metrics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Turnaround Scheduling** | MILP: minimize total turnaround time subject to resource constraints | MILP, GA, SA | Aircraft arrival/departure times, service task durations, GSE availability | Optimized service schedule, GSE assignments | Turnaround time (min), resource utilization (%), delay probability |
| **GSE Routing** | VRP (Vehicle Routing Problem): minimize travel distance/time | QAOA, GA, SA | GSE locations, service requests, airport graph, time windows | Optimal routes for each GSE unit | Total distance (m), fuel consumption (L), idle time (min) |
| **De-icing Resource Allocation** | QUBO: binary assignment of de-icing units to aircraft | QUBO, QAOA, SA | Weather forecast, aircraft queue, de-icing fluid inventory, equipment capacity | De-icing unit assignments, fluid usage | Aircraft de-iced per hour, fluid efficiency (L/aircraft), delay reduction (min) |
| **Platform Assignment** | Constraint satisfaction + optimization: assign aircraft to gates/stands | MILP, CSP, GA | Aircraft sizes, gate capabilities, passenger flow, turnaround requirements | Gate/stand assignments | Walking distance (m), gate conflicts (count), turnaround efficiency |
| **Mooring Load Distribution** | QP: distribute mooring loads to minimize structural stress | QP, LP | Wind load vectors, mooring point positions, aircraft CG, structural limits | Optimal tension per mooring line | Max stress (MPa), safety factor, load imbalance |
| **Servicing Sequence Optimization** | Scheduling with precedence: minimize makespan | GA, MILP, SA | Task dependencies, resource conflicts, priority weights | Optimal task order, start times | Makespan (min), critical path length, resource idle time (%) |

### Treats / Solves Notes

- **Turnaround Scheduling**: **Treats** turnaround delays by coordinating all ground services (fueling, catering, cleaning, maintenance). **Solves** via MILP to find feasible schedules that minimize total ground time while respecting precedence constraints.
  
- **GSE Routing**: **Treats** inefficient GSE utilization and excessive fuel consumption. **Solves** using quantum-inspired QAOA or GA to find near-optimal routes that minimize travel distance across the airport graph.

- **De-icing Resource Allocation**: **Treats** weather-induced delays and fluid waste. **Solves** via QUBO formulation, mapping aircraft-unit assignments to binary variables, optimized through quantum annealing or simulated annealing.

- **Platform Assignment**: **Treats** gate conflicts and passenger inconvenience. **Solves** using MILP with constraint satisfaction, balancing gate utilization, aircraft compatibility, and passenger walking distances.

- **Mooring Load Distribution**: **Treats** structural overload risks during high-wind events. **Solves** via QP to distribute tensile loads across mooring lines while maintaining safety margins.

- **Servicing Sequence Optimization**: **Treats** resource bottlenecks and service delays. **Solves** using GA or MILP to determine task ordering that minimizes total turnaround time.

## Variables / Constraints / Objectives

### Key Variables

- **Operational**: IATA turnaround standards, airport curfew windows

### Typical Objectives
