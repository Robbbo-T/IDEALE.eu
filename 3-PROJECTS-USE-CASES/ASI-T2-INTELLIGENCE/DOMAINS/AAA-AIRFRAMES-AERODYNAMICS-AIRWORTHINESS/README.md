## Overview

This domain curates the theoretical knowledge for **airframe structures, aerodynamic performance, and airworthiness certification**. It serves as a **knowledge base** (ontologies, methods, standards, models, playbooks) that **informs and governs** program deliverables via PLM/CAx skills and MAP services.

Scope includes metal/composite primary structure, aero/loads, flutter, stability & control, fatigue/damage tolerance, certification basis, and structural repair & maintenance engineering.

## Domain Definition (Canon)

**DOMAINS** represent areas of **theoretical knowledge and specialization**. They are **not** program deliverables; they regulate them through PLM/CAx competencies and MAP orchestration.
