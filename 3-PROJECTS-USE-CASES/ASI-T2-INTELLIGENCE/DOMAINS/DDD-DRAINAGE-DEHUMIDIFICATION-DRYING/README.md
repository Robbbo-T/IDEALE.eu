**Part of:** ASI-T2-INTELLIGENCE Â· **Domain:** DDD Â· **Category:** Knowledge Domain  
**Status:** Template Â· UTCS-anchored

## Overview

This domain curates the theoretical knowledge for **aircraft water management, moisture control, and drainage** across structures, cabins, holds, systems bays, and nacelles. It serves as a **knowledge base** (ontologies, methods, standards, models, playbooks) that **informs and governs** program deliverables via PLM/CAx skills and MAP services.

Scope includes condensation prediction and control, drain path design, bilge detection and pumping, drain mast heating/anti-ice, insulation/liners for moisture barriers, ECS water separation interfaces, lav/galley waste routing, cargo/cabin humidity management, corrosion risk mitigation, and drying procedures.

## Domain Definition (Canon)

**DOMAINS** are areas of **theoretical knowledge and specialization**. They are **not** program deliverables; they regulate them via PLM/CAx competencies and MAP orchestration.
