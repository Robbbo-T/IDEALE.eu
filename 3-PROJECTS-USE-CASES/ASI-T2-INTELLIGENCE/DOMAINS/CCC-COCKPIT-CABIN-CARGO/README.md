## QUANTUM_OA — Problems ⇄ Formulations ⇄ Algorithms

This domain addresses interior and cargo optimization through quantum-inspired methods. Below are specific problems, their formulations, applicable algorithms, and tractability metrics.

### Treats / Solves Notes

- **Cabin Layout Optimization**: **Treats** conflicting requirements (capacity vs. comfort vs. egress) by balancing seat density with regulatory compliance. **Solves** via MILP to find feasible layouts that maximize revenue while meeting 90-second egress and accessibility standards.

- **Emergency Egress Simulation**: **Treats** evacuation bottlenecks and panic scenarios. **Solves** using GA coupled with Monte Carlo simulation to identify optimal exit strategies and design interventions (e.g., wider aisles, repositioned exits).

- **Cargo Loading Sequence**: **Treats** CG excursions and inefficient space usage. **Solves** via bin-packing MILP combined with QP for CG trajectory control, ensuring structural limits and loading efficiency.

- **IFE Content Distribution**: **Treats** bandwidth congestion and uneven content availability. **Solves** using network flow LP/MILP to pre-cache popular content and optimize streaming paths, ensuring QoS for passengers.

- **Galley Provisioning**: **Treats** food waste and stockout risks. **Solves** via inventory optimization MILP considering demand forecasts, storage constraints, and service level targets.

- **Seat Comfort Optimization**: **Treats** passenger discomfort on long-haul flights. **Solves** using multi-objective GA (e.g., NSGA-II) to explore Pareto frontiers of seat pitch/width vs. capacity, balancing comfort and economics.
