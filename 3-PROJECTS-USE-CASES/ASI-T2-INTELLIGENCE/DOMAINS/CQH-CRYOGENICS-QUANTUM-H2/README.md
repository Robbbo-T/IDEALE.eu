## Overview

Knowledge base for **cryogenic hydrogen storage**, **quantum sensing**, and **ultra-low temperature systems** for advanced propulsion. This domain curates methods, models, and standards for safe handling, storage, and utilization of liquid hydrogen (LH₂) at cryogenic temperatures (~20 K), along with quantum-enhanced sensing for leak detection, temperature monitoring, and fuel quality assessment.

Cryogenic systems are critical for next-generation H₂ hybrid-electric propulsion, requiring specialized insulation, boil-off management, ortho-para conversion control, and quantum sensor integration for real-time monitoring.
