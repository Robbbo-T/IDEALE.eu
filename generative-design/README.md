# Generative Design with Cryptographic Binding

High-fidelity AI-generated designs with cryptographic ties to inputs, models, and approvals.

## Overview

Ensures generative design outputs are:
- **Traceable** to input requirements
- **Bound** to AI models used
- **Approved** by human reviewers
- **Defensible** in IP disputes

## Pipeline

```yaml
Input Requirements (hashed)
    ↓
AI Model (signed)
    ↓
Generated Design (cryptographically bound)
    ↓
Human Review (digitally signed)
    ↓
Final Approval (multi-signature)
    ↓
Blockchain Anchor (immutable proof)
```

## Components

### AI Models
- **Topology optimization** - Structural efficiency
- **Design space exploration** - Parameter sweeps
- **Constraint satisfaction** - Requirements validation
- **Multi-objective optimization** - Trade-off analysis

### Cryptographic Binding
Each generated design includes:

```json
{
  "design_id": "uuid",
  "bound_to": {
    "requirements_hash": "sha256:...",
    "constraints_hash": "sha256:...",
    "model_signature": "Ed25519:...",
    "training_data_hash": "sha256:..."
  },
  "generation_metadata": {
    "model_version": "1.2.3",
    "hyperparameters": {...},
    "compute_resources": {...},
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  },
  "approvals": [
    {
      "approver": "Chief Engineer",
      "decision": "approved",
      "signature": "base64...",
      "timestamp": "2024-01-20T14:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Output Generation
- **High-fidelity renders** - Photorealistic visualization
- **Technical drawings** - Manufacturing-ready
- **Simulation results** - FEA/CFD validation
- **Verification package** - Complete documentation

## Use Cases

1. **Aerospace** - Lightweight structures
2. **Automotive** - Crash optimization
3. **Architecture** - Building efficiency
4. **Medical** - Custom prosthetics

## Roadmap
