# SI Tests

This directory contains tests for the System Integration (SI) layer.

## Purpose

The SI (System Integration) layer is responsible for orchestrating interactions between different systems and managing interfaces. This tests directory should contain:

- Unit tests for the orchestration logic
- Integration tests for system interfaces
- Test fixtures and mock data
- Test configuration files

## Related Files

- [`../interfaces.yaml`](../interfaces.yaml) - Interface definitions
- [`../orchestration.py`](../orchestration.py) - Orchestration logic

## Running Tests

```bash
# Example: Run tests using pytest (when implemented)
pytest 2-PROGRAM-TEMPLATE/TFA/SYSTEMS/SI/tests/

# Or from this directory
cd 2-PROGRAM-TEMPLATE/TFA/SYSTEMS/SI/tests
pytest .
```

## Test Structure

Tests should follow the standard naming convention:
- `test_*.py` - Test files
- `*_test.py` - Alternative test file naming
- Use descriptive test function names: `test_<feature>_<scenario>_<expected_outcome>`

## Contributing

When adding new functionality to the SI layer, ensure corresponding tests are added to this directory to maintain code quality and prevent regressions.
