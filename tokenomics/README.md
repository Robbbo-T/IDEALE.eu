# Tokenomics - Optional Incentive Layer

Economic incentives for cross-organizational collaboration with verifiable contributions.

## Overview

**Optional** token-based system for:
- **Attribution** - Who contributed what
- **Valuation** - Economic value of contributions
- **Settlement** - Cross-org payments
- **Rewards** - Incentivize quality contributions

## Collaboration Models

### 1. Team Model
**Within single organization:**
- Internal contribution tracking
- Performance metrics
- Recognition system
- No cross-org payments

### 2. Cross-Org Model
**Between organizations (OEM ↔ Tier1 ↔ Tier2):**
- Contribution-based settlements
- Smart contracts for payments
- Automatic invoicing
- Dispute resolution

### 3. Ad-Hoc Model
**Temporary consortia:**
- Project-specific tokens
- Dynamic team formation
- Flexible reward distribution
- Sunset clauses

## Token Properties

```yaml
ideale_token:
  type: "utility"
  purpose: "contribution_settlement"
  blockchain: "polygon"
  standard: "ERC-20"
  features:
    - contribution_minting
    - cross_org_transfer
    - settlement_automation
    - governance_voting
```

## Contribution Valuation

Factors determining value:
- **Complexity** - Technical difficulty
- **Impact** - Effect on final product
- **Quality** - Validation results
- **Timeline** - Speed of delivery
- **IP value** - Intellectual property worth

## Smart Contracts

### Contribution Contract
```solidity
contract ContributionSettlement {
    function recordContribution(
        address contributor,
        bytes32 artifactId,
        uint256 impact
    ) external;
    
    function calculateValue(
        bytes32 artifactId
    ) external view returns (uint256);
    
    function settlePayments(
        bytes32 artifactId
    ) external;
}
```

### Reward Distribution
Automatic distribution based on:
- Contribution percentage
- Quality metrics
- Contractual agreements
- Governance decisions

## Use Cases

### Example 1: OEM-Supplier Collaboration
```
Airbus contributes 60% → 600 tokens
Safran contributes 30% → 300 tokens
Thales contributes 10% → 100 tokens

Total project value: 1000 tokens
Settlement executed automatically
```

### Example 2: Open Innovation
```
Public challenge issued
Multiple contributors submit designs
Best design wins token reward
Runner-ups receive participation tokens
All contributions recorded on-chain
```

## Governance

Token holders can vote on:
- Valuation algorithms
- Settlement policies
- Dispute resolution
- System upgrades

## Legal Considerations

- **Securities compliance** - Utility vs. security token
- **Tax implications** - Different jurisdictions
- **Payment regulations** - Cross-border settlements
- **Contract law** - Smart contract enforceability

## Opt-Out

Organizations can use IDEALE.eu **without tokenomics**:
- All provenance features available
- Traditional payment methods
- Standard contractual agreements
- No token requirement

## Roadmap

- [ ] Token launch (Q2 2025)
- [ ] Exchange listings
- [ ] Fiat on/off ramps
- [ ] Mobile wallet integration
- [ ] Governance portal
