## Architectural Components

### MAL-EEM - Machine Learning Ethics, Empathy, Explainability, and Mitigation
**Ensures human-centric ML design and risk management.**

The MAL-EEM framework provides:
- **Ethics**: Bias detection, fairness metrics, ethical guidelines
- **Empathy**: Human-centered design, accessibility, user advocacy
- **Explainability**: Model interpretability, decision transparency, audit trails
- **Mitigation**: Risk management, safety interlocks, human-in-the-loop

All AI/ML systems in IDEALE must pass MAL-EEM review before deployment.

**Used in**: ASI-T2-INTELLIGENCE (primary), all projects with AI/ML components  
**Implementation**: `2-PROGRAM-TEMPLATE/MAL-SERVICES/MAL-EEM/`  
**Standards**: ISO/IEC 42001 (AI Management), EU AI Act compliance

### UTCS - UiX Threading Context/Content/Cache and Structure/Style/Sheet
**Canonical threading of context, content, cache and structure/style for provenance and UX integrity.**

UTCS provides the foundational threading model for:
- **Context**: Situational awareness and state management
- **Content**: Data payload and semantic meaning
- **Cache**: Performance optimization and local state
- **Structure**: Organizational hierarchy and relationships
- **Style**: Presentation and user experience
- **Sheet**: Consolidated view with all layers

This corrected definition replaces earlier interpretations. UTCS ensures that every artifact carries complete provenance through its threaded structure.

**Used in**: All projects (foundational)  
**Implementation**: Embedded in artifact metadata schemas  
**Standards**: W3C standards (context), IDEALE artifact schemas

#### Abstract (UTCS, canon YAML)

UTCS (**UiX Threading Context/Content/Cache and Structure/Style/Sheet**) is the **canonical YAML data structure** that threads context, content, derived artifacts, and integrity throughout the entire TFA lifecycle (**QS→FWD→UE→FE→CB→QB**). It defines a stable identifier (**utcs_id**), product/domain/LLC metadata, and a verifiable **provenance** block (MAL-EEM) with cryptographic signatures. Its **threading/structure/style/sheet** sections ensure traceability between CAD/CAE models, decisions, evidence, and exportable artifacts, eliminating fragile file paths and promoting **UTCS-MI** anchors. Integrated into CI pipelines, UTCS enables schema validation, change control, and **content_hash** calculation for audits and certification (CS-25, S1000D, ATA). In PAx/AAA contexts, it enables **UE** snapshots of "as-routed/as-installed" configurations, clearance/accessibility metrics, and installation orchestration (**FE**) under spatial constraints (**CB**) and optimization (**QB**). The result is a single, verifiable, and automatable thread connecting design, integration, evidence, and compliance in aerospace and logistics programs.

### TFA - Technology and Functional Architecture
**Integrates classical and quantum-inspired computational layers.**

TFA is the overarching framework that coordinates:
- **Classical computing** (CB, UE) for deterministic processing
- **Quantum-inspired computing** (QB, QS, FWD) for optimization and exploration
- **Coordination layer** (FE) for distributed decision-making
- **Control framework** (QAFbW) for safety-critical systems

TFA defines the canonical flow: **QS → FWD → UE → CB/QB → FE**

**Used in**: All projects (architectural foundation)  
**Implementation**: `2-PROGRAM-TEMPLATE/TFA/`  
**Related**: All other architecture terms are components of TFA

### QAFbW - Quantum-Augmented Flight by Wire
**Quantum/hybrid control framework.**

QAFbW extends traditional fly-by-wire systems with quantum-inspired optimization for:
- Real-time trajectory optimization
- Multi-objective control (safety, efficiency, comfort)
- Predictive control under uncertainty
- Adaptive control law synthesis

Uses QB for control optimization, FWD for prediction, UE for state estimation.

**Used in**: AMPEL360-AIR-T, AMPEL360-SPACE-T, GAIA-AIR-UNMANNED  
**Implementation**: `2-PROGRAM-TEMPLATE/TFA/` + domain-specific control laws  
**Standards**: DO-178C (software), DO-254 (hardware), CS-25 (certification)

## TFA Computational Components

The TFA framework defines a specific computational flow from quantum-inspired to classical:

### QS - Quantum Superposition State
**Probabilistic state space for massive provenance.**

QS represents:
- All possible states simultaneously (superposition analogy)
- Probabilistic exploration of solution space
- Massive parallel provenance tracking
- Immutable state history (blockchain-compatible)

**Use cases**:
- Provenance tracking for supply chains (INFRANET-RETAIL-LOGISTICS)
- Decision space exploration (ASI-T2-INTELLIGENCE)
- Audit trails for MRO (H2-CHAIN-MRO)

**Implementation**: `2-PROGRAM-TEMPLATE/TFA/STATES/QS/`  
**Storage**: Blockchain, distributed ledgers, immutable databases

### FWD - Forward Wave Dynamics
**Predictive modeling of quantum possibilities.**

FWD analyzes the QS to provide:
- Predictive modeling and forecasting
- Uncertainty quantification
- Risk assessment and scenario planning
- "What-if" analysis across the possibility space

FWD acts as the bridge from probabilistic (QS) to deterministic (UE) worlds.

**Use cases**:
- Trajectory prediction (AMPEL360-SPACE-T)
- Collision avoidance (GAIA-SPACE-SATELLITES)
- Market forecasting (INFRANET-RETAIL-LOGISTICS)

**Implementation**: `2-PROGRAM-TEMPLATE/TFA/WAVES/FWD/`  
**Methods**: Monte Carlo, Bayesian inference, ensemble modeling

### UE - Unit/Unique Element
**Deterministic snapshot for classical processing.**

UE represents the "collapsed wave function" - a specific, verifiable state:
- Single deterministic state
- Classically processable
- Cryptographically verifiable
- Timestamped snapshot

UE is the fundamental unit of classical computation in TFA.

**Use cases**:
- Sensor readings (GAIA-SEA-PROBES)
- Maintenance records (H2-CHAIN-MRO)
- Component state snapshots (all projects)

**Implementation**: `2-PROGRAM-TEMPLATE/TFA/ELEMENTS/UE/`  
**Storage**: Traditional databases, file systems, UTCS artifacts

## TFA Solver Components

Once in the UE/classical domain, two solver types are available:

### CB - Classical Bit / Solver
**Classical algorithms enforcing physical constraints.**

CB provides:
- Constraint satisfaction problems (CSP)
- Physical law enforcement (dynamics, thermodynamics)
- Deterministic algorithms
- Rule-based systems

**Use cases**:
- Physics constraints (all vehicle projects)
- Regulatory compliance checks (all projects)
- Safety interlocks (GAIA-AIR-UNMANNED, INFRANET-RETAIL-LOGISTICS)

**Implementation**: `2-PROGRAM-TEMPLATE/TFA/BITS/CB/`  
**Methods**: Linear programming, constraint propagation, rule engines

### QB - Qubit Inspired Solver
**Quantum-inspired optimization engine (QUBO, QAOA).**

QB uses quantum-inspired algorithms for:
- Combinatorial optimization (TSP, VRP, scheduling)
- QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization)
- QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm)
- Simulated annealing and genetic algorithms

QB operates on classical hardware but uses quantum-inspired heuristics.

**Use cases**:
- Flight path optimization (AMPEL360-AIR-T)
- Route optimization (GAIA-AIR-UNMANNED, INFRANET-RETAIL-LOGISTICS)
- Resource allocation (all projects)

**Implementation**: `2-PROGRAM-TEMPLATE/TFA/QUBITS/QB/`  
**Tools**: D-Wave Ocean SDK, Qiskit Optimization, Google Cirq

## TFA Coordination Component

### FE - Federation Entanglement
**Decision chain coordination across distributed UEs.**

FE coordinates multiple UEs (systems, agents, or components) for:
- Distributed decision-making
- Multi-agent coordination
- Consensus protocols
- Federated learning

FE maintains coherence across the distributed system without centralized control.

**Use cases**:
- Multi-system decision chains (ASI-T2-INTELLIGENCE)
- Swarm coordination (GAIA-AIR-UNMANNED)
- Supply chain orchestration (INFRANET-RETAIL-LOGISTICS)

**Implementation**: `2-PROGRAM-TEMPLATE/TFA/ELEMENTS/FE/`  
**Methods**: Byzantine consensus, federated learning, RAFT/Paxos protocols

- **MAL-EEM**: `2-PROGRAM-TEMPLATE/MAL-SERVICES/MAL-EEM/`

These services provide APIs and SDKs for project implementation.

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing TFA components:

1. **Start with the problem**: What are you optimizing/predicting/tracking?
2. **Choose the right component**: Not every problem needs quantum-inspired methods
3. **Follow the canonical flow**: QS → FWD → UE → CB/QB → FE
4. **Document provenance**: Every transformation must be traceable
5. **Pass MAL-EEM review**: Especially for AI/ML and autonomous systems
6. **Use UTCS threading**: Maintain context, content, and structure throughout
