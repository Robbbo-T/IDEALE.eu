# AMPEL360 Enhanced Program Architecture

**Status:** CHALLENGING - Enhanced Risk Mitigation Active  
**Feasibility Score:** 5.5/10 → 7.5/10 (target after mitigation)  
**Timeline:** 2025-2034 (realistic adjustment)  
**Investment Phase:** Technology Maturation & Risk Reduction

## Executive Summary

The AMPEL360 program comprises two complementary manned vehicle architectures:

1. **AMPEL360-H2-BWB-Q100**: Hydrogen-powered Blended Wing Body aircraft for up to 180 passengers
2. **AMPEL360-Space-T**: Orbital transfer vehicle for up to 18 passengers + 2 crew

Both programs leverage the IDEALE.eu framework for comprehensive domain integration (AAA, PPP, CQH, EEE, EDI, CCC, LCC, DDD), digital thread implementation, and verifiable evidence chains.

## Key Features

### Technology Readiness Levels (TRL)
- **Current State**: Critical technologies at TRL 4-6
- **Target State**: TRL 8-9 by 2032-2034
- **Gap Analysis**: 9 out of 12 critical path technologies require substantial development

### Market Opportunity (2024-2030)
- **Hydrogen Aircraft**: $533M → $5.1B (28.7% CAGR)
- **BWB Aircraft**: $50M → $2.5B (50x growth potential)
- **Orbital Transfer Vehicles**: $1.7B → $5.4B (15.6% CAGR)
- **Space Tourism**: $1.3B → $4.9B (17.5% CAGR)

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
