## Risk Mitigation

### Certification Delays

**Primary Risks:**
1. Special Conditions development delays
2. Novel technology acceptance
3. Compliance demonstration complexity

**Mitigation:**
- Early regulatory engagement (started 2025 Q1)
- Progressive disclosure approach
- Precedent identification (X-48, Boeing BWB studies)
- Safety case progressive build

### Market Impact

**Risk:** Certification delays impact launch customer commitments

**Mitigation:**
- Contractual flexibility clauses
- Cargo-first reduces passenger cert pressure
- Incremental passenger certification reduces all-or-nothing risk
