# AMPEL360 Decision Gates

This directory contains the go/no-go decision gate framework for the AMPEL360 program, establishing clear criteria for major investment and strategic decisions.

## Overview

The AMPEL360 program uses **three major decision gates** to ensure systematic risk management and enable informed investment decisions at critical program milestones.

## Gate Structure

Each gate evaluates the program across four key dimensions:
- **Technical Criteria** (40%): TRL achievements, test completions, system integration
- **Regulatory Criteria** (20-25%): Certification pathway milestones, safety approvals
- **Commercial Criteria** (20%): Customer commitments, market validation, infrastructure
- **Financial Criteria** (15-20%): Funding security, cost performance, cash flow

## Decision Gates

### Gate 1: Technology Readiness Gate (2026 Q4)
**Objective**: Validate critical technology maturation before Phase 2 development investment

**Key Criteria:**
- H2 storage TRL ≥ 6
- Fuel cells demonstrated at ≥5MW
- BWB demonstrator with 50+ flight hours
- EASA Special Condition drafts submitted
- €2B Phase 2 funding committed
- 2+ launch customer Letters of Intent

**Decision Options**: GO / PIVOT (cargo focus) / EXTEND / NO-GO

### Gate 2: System Integration Gate (2028 Q4)
**Objective**: Confirm system-level readiness before certification and production commitment

**Key Criteria:**
- BWB demonstrator 200+ flight hours
- H2 propulsion flight-qualified
- Fuel cells 25MW demonstrated
- Space-T ≥2 uncrewed missions successful
- Certification basis agreed with EASA
- 5+ aircraft firm orders
- 3+ airports committed to H2 infrastructure

**Decision Options**: GO / EXTEND / PIVOT (single program) / CONSOLIDATE

---

### Gate 3: Market Entry Gate (2030 Q4)
**Objective**: Validate operational readiness before full production ramp

**Key Criteria:**
- Cargo variant Type Certified or imminent
- Space-T ≥1 successful crewed mission
- 50-pax passenger variant in flight test
- 10+ aircraft firm orders (€2.5B+ value)
- 3+ airports H2-operational
- Positive cash flow from cargo operations

**Decision Options**: GO (full production) / OPTIMIZE / CONSOLIDATE / FOCUS

## Gate Review Process

**Timeline**: T-6 months preliminary scoring → T-3 months evidence compilation → T-1 month board briefing → 2-day gate meeting

**Decision Authority**: AMPEL360 Board of Directors (2/3 majority required)

**Documentation Required**:
- Evidence package
- Independent technical review
- Financial audit
- Risk assessment update
- Program Director recommendation

## Inter-Gate Monitoring

**Monthly Metrics:**
- TRL progression vs plan
- Test completion rate
- Cost/schedule variance
- Risk exposure

**Quarterly Reviews:**
- Program Review Board
- Stakeholder updates
- Early warning system for red flags
