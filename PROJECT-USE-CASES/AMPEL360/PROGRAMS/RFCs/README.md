2. **Technology Maturation Roadmap** - 15 critical technologies, TRL progression plans, €11.3B investment
3. **Infrastructure Development Consortium** - Multi-stakeholder alliance, €3.2B H2 infrastructure
4. **Phased Certification Strategy** - Aircraft and spacecraft certification pathways
5. **Enhanced Digital Thread** - Digital twin framework, blockchain evidence chain, quantum integration
6. **Risk-Adjusted Development Centers** - Hamburg, Munich, Toulouse, Bremen, Zurich facilities
7. **Supply Chain Risk Mitigation** - Dual sourcing, vertical integration strategies
8. **Revised Financial Model** - €14B total investment across 3 phases (2025-2034)
9. **Market Entry Strategy** - Launch customers, pricing, penetration plans
10. **Performance Metrics & Gates** - Go/no-go decision gates with clear criteria
11. **Synergy Optimization** - Cross-program benefits, €700M+ savings
12. **Gap Analysis & Mitigation** - Key gaps and action plans
13. **Compliance Framework** - EASA, NASA, ESA standards mapping

**Supersedes**: Initial Program Concept v1.0

**Approval Required From**:
- AMPEL360 Technical Committee
