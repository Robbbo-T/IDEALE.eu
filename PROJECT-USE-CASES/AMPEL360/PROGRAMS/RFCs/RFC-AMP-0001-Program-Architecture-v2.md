# RFC-AMP-0001: AMPEL360 Enhanced Program Architecture v2

**Status:** Active  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** 2025-01-20  
**Authors:** AMPEL360 Technical Committee  
**Supersedes:** Initial Program Concept v1.0

## Abstract

This RFC defines the enhanced AMPEL360 program architecture incorporating comprehensive risk mitigation strategies, phased certification approaches, and realistic timeline adjustments based on technical feasibility analysis. The program targets dual manned vehicle development: hydrogen-powered aviation (H2-BWB-Q100) and orbital space transport (Space-T).

## Motivation

Initial program assessment revealed ambitious goals with **feasibility score 5.5/10**, requiring enhanced risk mitigation to achieve viability. This RFC addresses:

1. **Technology Readiness Gaps**: 9 out of 12 critical technologies require substantial development (TRL gaps ≥3)
2. **Certification Pathway Uncertainty**: No commercial BWB under CS-25; H2 propulsive certification normalization post-2032
3. **Infrastructure Dependencies**: Airport H2 facilities lag aircraft development timelines
4. **Timeline Realism**: 18-24 month delays highly probable without aggressive risk management

## Program Framework

### Core Objectives

## Conclusion

This RFC establishes a comprehensive, risk-mitigated architecture for the AMPEL360 dual vehicle program. Key enablers for success include:

1. **Realistic Timeline**: 9-year development with explicit risk mitigation gates
2. **Phased Approach**: Demonstrator → Cargo → Passenger progression reduces risk
3. **Infrastructure Consortium**: Multi-stakeholder approach addresses ecosystem gaps
4. **Technology Maturation**: Focused investment in TRL 4-6 critical technologies
5. **Synergy Capture**: Shared facilities, suppliers, and knowledge reduce costs by €700M+
6. **Regulatory Engagement**: Early, continuous engagement with EASA/NASA/ESA
7. **Market Validation**: Launch customer partnerships and incremental capacity growth

**Recommendation**: PROCEED with enhanced risk mitigation strategy, revised timelines, and immediate focus on Gate 1 (2026 Q4) success criteria.
