# ESA Multi-Contractor Collaboration Demo

Demonstrates how European Space Agency projects can manage requirements, designs, and approvals across multiple contractors with full traceability.

## Scenario

1. **ESA** defines spacecraft requirements
2. **Thales Alenia Space** creates initial design
3. **Airbus Defence and Space** integrates propulsion
4. **OHB System** adds payload
5. All contributions tracked with cryptographic provenance
6. **ESA approves** final design with multi-signature

## Workflow

```
Requirements (ESA)
    ↓
Initial Design (Thales)
    ↓
Propulsion Integration (Airbus)
    ↓
Payload Addition (OHB)
    ↓
Validation & Approval (ESA)
```

## Files

- `requirement-flow/` - Requirements and their traces
- `design-iterations/` - Design versions from each contractor
- `approval-chain/` - Multi-party approval signatures

## Key Benefits

✅ **Multi-org collaboration** - Each party contributes without tool constraints
✅ **Requirements traceability** - Design linked to requirements
✅ **Approval workflow** - Multi-signature support
✅ **Audit trail** - Complete project history
