this repository enables Europe’s strategic sectors—Intelligence, Defense, Energy, Aerospace, Logistics, and ESG—to produce verifiable, portable artifacts that move across tools and organizations without vendor lock-in. Teams can participate, contribute, and earn via a selectable tokenomics mark (team, cross-org, or ad-hoc clusters). The roadmap adds high-fidelity generative design graphics cryptographically tied to inputs, models, and approvals—transparent from concept to operation—with automated provenance suitable for defensible IP roadmaps
