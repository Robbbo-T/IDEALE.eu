IDEALE.eu makes engineering artifacts portable, verifiable, and legally defensible across organizations â€” with cryptographic provenance and zero vendor lock-in. This repository contains the IDEALE Evidence Framework (IEF) specifications and reference implementation that enables cross-tool collaboration (CAD/CAE/CAM/PLM) without information loss. Every artifact is cryptographically signed, every change is blockchain-anchored, and every contribution is attributed. Teams can collaborate via team, cross-org, or ad-hoc models with optional tokenomics for settlements. The infrastructure supports high-fidelity generative design with cryptographic binding to inputs and approvals, providing transparent provenance from concept to operation suitable for defensible IP roadmaps.
