## Code of Conduct

IDEALE.eu is committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. We expect:

- **Respectful Communication**: Treat all participants with respect
- **Constructive Feedback**: Focus on improving artifacts and processes
- **Confidentiality**: Respect classification levels and data sensitivity
- **Professionalism**: Maintain high standards in all contributions
- **Collaboration**: Work together across organizational boundaries

## Getting Started

### 1. Choose Your Participation Model

Select the model that best fits your situation:

**Team-Based**
- Best for: Organizations with internal teams
- Requirements: Organization registration
- Benefits: Simplified governance, internal reward distribution

**Cross-Organizational**
- Best for: Multi-organization projects
- Requirements: Signed collaboration agreements
- Benefits: Shared IP management, transparent contributions

**Ad-Hoc Cluster**
- Best for: Dynamic, project-based work
- Requirements: Individual contributor agreement
- Benefits: Flexible participation, task-based rewards

### 2. Set Up Your Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Robbbo-T/IDEALE.eu.git
cd IDEALE.eu

# Install dependencies (when available)
npm install  # or pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure your identity
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Set up artifact signing
# Generate GPG key for artifact signatures
gpg --full-generate-key
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
git config user.signingkey YOUR_KEY_ID
```

### 3. Understand the Sectors

Familiarize yourself with the strategic sectors:

- **Intelligence**: Data analytics, threat assessment, information security
- **Defense**: Military specifications, defense systems, compliance
- **Energy**: Power systems, renewable energy, grid infrastructure
- **Aerospace**: Aviation, space systems, satellite technology
- **Logistics**: Supply chain, transportation, inventory management
- **ESG**: Sustainability metrics, governance frameworks, social impact

## Participation Models

### Team-Based Model

**Setup**
1. Register your organization
2. Define team structure
3. Configure internal reward policies
4. Set classification levels

**Workflow**
```
Individual Contribution → Team Review → Internal Approval → Platform Submission
```

**Governance**
- Team lead approves contributions
- Internal reward distribution
- Organization-level reporting

### Cross-Organizational Model

**Setup**
1. Establish collaboration agreement
2. Define shared governance
3. Set IP ownership terms
4. Configure cross-org workflows

**Workflow**
```
Contribution → Multi-org Review → Consensus → Joint Submission
```

**Governance**
- Multi-stakeholder approval
- Transparent contribution tracking
- Shared reward pools

### Ad-Hoc Cluster Model

**Setup**
1. Sign individual contributor agreement
2. Create or join project cluster
3. Define cluster governance
4. Establish task-based rewards

**Workflow**
```
Task Claim → Development → Peer Review → Cluster Approval → Submission
```

**Governance**
- Democratic or meritocratic voting
- Dynamic membership
- Task-level rewards

## Contribution Types

## Development Workflow

### 1. Branch Strategy
```
main (protected)
  ↓
develop
  ↓
feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Commit Standards
```
type(sector): brief description

Detailed explanation of changes.

Refs: #issue-number
Sector: intelligence|defense|energy|aerospace|logistics|esg
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

### 3. Pull Request Process
1. Create feature branch
2. Make minimal, focused changes
3. Add or update tests
4. Update documentation
5. Submit pull request
6. Address review feedback
7. Obtain required approvals
8. Merge when approved

### 4. Artifact Submission
```bash
# Validate artifact format
ideale validate artifact.json

# Sign artifact
ideale sign artifact.json --key YOUR_KEY_ID

# Submit to platform
ideale submit artifact.json --sector energy --model team
```

## Artifact Standards

### Metadata Requirements
Every artifact must include:
```json
{
  "id": "uuid-v4",
  "type": "specification|design|report|analysis",
  "sector": "strategic-sector",
  "format": "format-identifier",
  "version": "semver",
  "created": "ISO-8601",
  "creator": "did:identifier",
  "classification": "public|internal|confidential|secret",
  "signatures": ["signature-array"]
}
```

### Format Guidelines

**Documents**
- Use Markdown for general documentation
- Use AsciiDoc for complex technical docs
- Include table of contents for documents >10 pages
- Use consistent heading hierarchy

**Diagrams**
- Prefer text-based formats (PlantUML, Mermaid)
- Export to SVG for portability
- Include source files in repository
- Use semantic naming

**Data**
- Use JSON or YAML for structured data
- Include schema definitions
- Validate against schemas
- Document all fields

### Classification Levels
- **Public**: No restrictions, openly shareable
- **Internal**: Organization-internal use
- **Confidential**: Restricted distribution, NDA required
- **Secret**: Defense-grade security, clearance required

## Tokenomics and Rewards

### Contribution Tracking
All contributions are automatically tracked:
- Artifact submissions: Base value
- Code contributions: Complexity-based value
- Reviews: Quality-weighted value
- Knowledge sharing: Impact-based value

### Reward Calculation
```
Reward = Base Value × Complexity × Quality × Sector Multiplier × Model Factor

Where:
- Base Value: Standard unit for contribution type
- Complexity: 1.0 - 3.0 based on technical difficulty
- Quality: 0.5 - 2.0 based on review scores
- Sector Multiplier: Strategic importance (1.0 - 2.0)
- Model Factor: Participation model adjustment
```

### Reputation System
- **Contributions**: Number and quality of artifacts
- **Reviews**: Accuracy and helpfulness of reviews
- **Collaboration**: Cross-org and mentorship activities
- **Expertise**: Sector-specific recognition

### Claiming Rewards
Rewards are distributed based on your participation model:
- **Team-Based**: Distributed by team lead
- **Cross-Org**: Distributed by governance body
- **Ad-Hoc**: Claimed upon task completion
