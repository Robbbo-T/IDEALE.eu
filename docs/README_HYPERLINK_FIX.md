# README Hyperlink Validation

## Issue Fixed

**Problem:** Line 190 in README.md contained a plain text reference to `tests/` without a proper markdown hyperlink, making it non-clickable. Additionally, the directory was named `{tests}` (with curly braces) instead of the standard `tests`.

**Solution:**
1. Renamed directory: `2-PROGRAM-TEMPLATE/TFA/SYSTEMS/SI/{tests}` → `tests`
2. Added proper markdown hyperlink on line 190: `[tests/](./2-PROGRAM-TEMPLATE/TFA/SYSTEMS/SI/tests/)`

## Validation

All 411 internal hyperlinks in README.md have been validated and are working correctly:
- ✅ No dead links
- ✅ All paths in Repository Structure Index are properly hyperlinked
- ✅ All directories and files referenced are accessible

## Testing

To validate all README hyperlinks:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_readme_links.py
```

This script checks:
1. All internal hyperlinks point to existing files/directories
2. All paths in the Repository Structure Index section have proper hyperlinks
3. No broken or dead links exist

Exit code:
- `0`: All links are valid
- `1`: Dead links or missing hyperlinks found

## Future Maintenance

Run the validation script before committing changes to README.md:

```bash
# Validate README links
python3 scripts/validate_readme_links.py

# If all checks pass (exit code 0), proceed with commit
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update README"
```

## CI/CD Integration (Optional)

Consider adding this check to your GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- name: Validate README hyperlinks
  run: python3 scripts/validate_readme_links.py
```
